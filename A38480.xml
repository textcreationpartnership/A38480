         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> On his Majeſty's being converted into the Catholick Church.</head>
               <p>THIS I know will be offenſive to my Subjects if it ſhould take air, and therefore in Policy am obliged to conceal it; but that I am ſecure enough as to God and my own Conſcience, I have no reaſon to doubt: 'Tis the Catholick Church whereof I am now a Member, and it's that Church which in the Bibles of the Hereticks themſelves is called the <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth;</hi> then why ſhould I ſcruple to ſubmit my ſelf to her Direction?</p>
               <p>Did not my Grandfather K. <hi>James,</hi> though he maul'd <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> give the Pope the Title of <hi>Moſt Holy Father, and declare his Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to meet the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>half way?</hi> Did not my Father, whom the very Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks acknowledg a Martyr, in like manner,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98018:11"/> give the Pope thoſe Titles which they call <hi>Names of Blaſphemy?</hi> If he had thought the Catholick Religion damnable, or believed that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches the <hi>Doctrine of Devils,</hi> would he ever have taken a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Princeſs into his Boſom? or granted ſuch Conceſſions in favour of her Religion, and ſuffered it to ſpread ſo much in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? Would he have imployed the Iriſh in his Armies after they had cut the Proteſtants Throats? or would he ever have made Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> his Favourite, who brought ſuch Innovations into the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and declared his good liking to a Cardinal's Cap, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were but a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? So that I am ſafe enough as to what concerns my Soul, having not only the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> poſitively for me, but alſo thoſe of the <hi>alterius orbis Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus,</hi> not at all againſt me. Then ſurely I may venture my Salvation on the ſame bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom with my Mother, and embarque in a Church which uncontrovertibly appears not to have been altogether diſreliſhing to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Let it go which way it will, I am of the ſureſt ſide: the Catholicks ſay, <hi>that out of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>there is no Salvation;</hi> and Proteſtants acknowledg, <hi>that in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>there is Salvation:</hi> and though it ſhould
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98018:11"/> be true what I have learn'd from my Tutor <hi>Hobbs,</hi> (and am indeed inclin'd to believe) <hi>that all Religion is but a Trick of State to keep the People in obedience;</hi> yet a Profeſſion of Religion is neceſſary for a Prince as well as others, according to <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s Maxim, <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem dum vis fallere, finge Deum:</hi> and certainly that Religion of which it is a Fundamental Principle, that <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> is moſt agreeable to a Prince who would maintain or advance his Prerogative: for where it is allowed, as amongſt all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, to examine the Dictates of their Ghoſtly Fathers, in relation to the Church, it muſt unavoidably follow, that the People will alſo claim the like Privilege to canvaſs the Orders of their Civil Fathers, in relation to the State. Then let the Hereticks talk as they pleaſe of <hi>the Kings of the Earth giving their Power to the Beaſt:</hi> I ſee that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the beſt Expedient for any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch who deſigns to be abſolute, to be an obedient Son to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who can inſure him not only his Subjects Perſons, but alſo their Conſciences and Purſes, ſeeing they muſt do and believe as the Church will have them.</p>
               <p>True! it is my Misfortune that a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Biſhop, and ſeveral Proteſtant Lords, who have follow'd me hither, are privy to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98018:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> my Converſion, which might indeed prove fatal to my Affairs, if it were not their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as well as mine to conceal it: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Reſtitution depends on mine, I have no reaſon to fear that they will divulge it. And for the Satisfaction of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though I have no Cauſe to profeſs to be of the Religion of Proteſtants who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my Father, and give the Ignominious Character of an Idolatreſs to my Mother; yet ſeeing the Principles of the Catholick Church allow Mental Reſervation, and that Chriſt himſelf did not reject <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> thô a Night-Diſciple, the Roman Catholicks cannot be angry that I ſtill profeſs my ſelf a Proteſtant, eſpecially ſeeing thereby I ſhall be the more capable of doing them Service: and thus I find my ſelf obliged to give an early Aſſent to my Grandfather K. <hi>James</hi>'s Maxim, which he had from <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. of <hi>France,</hi> who never learn'd any other Latin Words, <hi>viz. Neſcit regnare qui neſcit diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare.</hi> Nor do I know why it ſhould be any greater Stain to my Honour, to feign my ſelf a Proteſtant for the Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> than it was to my Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. to feign himſelf a Catholick for the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and may my Endeavours have the ſame Succeſs, but a happier Exit. <hi>And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World will have it that there is a God,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98018:12"/> I can loſe no more but a little Breath to make ſome Addreſſes if there be none; but ſeeing it's ſafer to venture with the bulk of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than to rely on the Efforts of ſome Men of Wit, I am reſolved to lift up the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O thou Almighty Being! who createdſt the Heavens and the Earth, by whom Kings reign and Princes decree Juſtice, to thee I refer my Cauſe. for a final Deciſion. Thou art King of Kings, who putteſt down one and ſetteſt up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore the fitteſt for me to make Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication unto. I have been taught by thoſe who call themſelves thy Ambaſſadors, and would have me to believe it to be thy Law, that Kings are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to none but thy ſelf, as being thy Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents, and Gods on Earth. Vindicate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Juſtice of my Cauſe againſt thoſe Men who have not only uſurp'd my Throne, but thine, for I am accountable to none but thee: Give Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to my Arms and Endeavours againſt them: And ſeeing thou haſt ſaid, that Vengeance is thine, and thou wilt repay it, let not the hoary Heads of thoſe who ſhed my Father's and thy Vice-gerent's Blood go down in Peace to the Grave. And give me Strength, O thou moſt High, to execute Vengeance upon a bloody Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thou who didſt grant</hi> Samſon'<hi>s Deſire to be reveng'd on the Philiſtines for his two Eyes, liſten

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> On his Majeſty's accepting of the <hi>Scots</hi> Propoſals, and taking the Solemn League and Covenant in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Order of Nature is ſtrangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted when the Head is become the Tail: I, who ought to give Laws to my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, muſt now receive Laws from them; and it adds to the Miſery of my Fate, that I muſt obey. My Father by his Stiffneſs did loſe both his Crown and his Life; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the one, and obtain the other, I muſt comply. My Mother, who had no ſmall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on his Refuſal, does now preſs me to accept the Terms: ſo that at once I muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure my Religion and Prerogative, that I may the better advance them both. It's true that this will reflect upon my Honour, but of two Evils I muſt chuſe the leaſt: If I do not comply, my Prerogative is loſt, for I ſhall never be admitted to poſſeſs my Crown; if I don't abjure the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver promote her Intereſt, nor be rendred ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98018:13"/> of doing her Enemies Hurt. My Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is known to be a Princeſs of Senſe, lays an Obligation of Duty upon me, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Her Zeal for the Catholick Religion is known, and as a Daughter of <hi>France</hi> ſhe is better inſtructed in the Pretenſions of the Crown, than to adviſe to any thing that may really leſſen the Prerogative in the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore I am reſolved to take the Advice which ſhe gave me in her Letter, <hi>not doubting but that according to her Suggeſtion there, I ſhall after my Reſtitution find an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to free my ſelf from my Bonds.</hi> Nor can it reflect upon my Parts to be govern'd by my Mother, whoſe Counſels were Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to ſo great a Monarch as my Father.</p>
               <p>For the Roman Catholick Princes they know my Mind; I ſent the Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſs</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to the Courts of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> to ſollicite their Aſſiſtance for my Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on which the Advancement of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does ſo much depend. I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Advice of the Council of <hi>France,</hi> to comply with the Scots, ſo that I am ſafe enough as to any Reflections from thoſe of the Roman Communion, though I profeſs my ſelf to be of another. I have alſo tried what may be expected from the Aſſiſtance of the Iriſh, before I would accept of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98018:14"/> of the Scots; but ſeeing they cannot defend themſelves, I am ſure they are unable to reſtore me, and therefore I muſt depend upon the latter, though much againſt my Mind: But Heaven, it ſeems, thinks fit to humble me ſo far, that I muſt rely on the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Aſſiſtance of thoſe whoſe Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs and Rebellion laid the Foundations of my Father's Ruine. But why ſhould I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond? is it not poſſible that the Fates may have put this Opportunity in my hand, to revenge his Blood upon them and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Kingdom, according to the ſolemn Vow which my Brother <hi>James</hi> and I have made, <hi>to ſacrifice thouſands to the Memory of our Father, and ten thouſands to the Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our dear Mother?</hi> And as the Scots by their Rebellion were firſt in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, may they atone for it by being firſt in the Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>True, they are a cunning People, and if they ſmell the Deſign, it ruines my Affairs, but I muſt manage them with Prudence: The Presbyterians are now on the Top of the Wheel, and teſtify'd an Averſion to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Blood, which affords me a ſpecious Pretext of careſſing them; but if they find me too eaſy, it will render me cheap, and therefore I muſt ſtand aloof for a time. Some of their Commiſſioners I have already bought
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98018:14"/> off, and thoſe will certainly eſpouſe my Cauſe; I muſt allarm them with their Danger from the Engliſh Sectaries, and the Deſigns of that new-rais'd Commonwealth. This will be a Pretence for bringing in the Cavaliers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Country againſt the Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which will divide the Presbyterians amongſt themſelves; and if I once get but part of them on my ſide, it will cover my Deſigns againſt the whole: <hi>I muſt pretend to be zealous for their Covenant, and bewail the Sins of my Father's Houſe: I muſt admit ſome of their Ring-leaders for my Chaplains, and that will attract the Applauſe of the Mob. I muſt indulge the Nobility of my Court in their Practices, and that will defend me againſt the Rigour of their Church: I muſt profeſs a great Paſſion for the Liberties of the Subject, and that will procure me the Concurrence of their States.</hi> And by theſe Methods I hope to accompliſh my Deſigns; for when they are engaged againſt one another, in the firſt Place, and <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Republicans in the next, let the Loſs fall on which ſide it will, it is my Gain, I ſhall be rid of ſo many dangerous Enemies, and their Fall will be the Riſe of my Throne: for if the Presbyterians prevail, they are for Monarchy, though limited; and when their old Friends, but preſent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, the Independants, are ſubdued, it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98018:15"/> will be eaſy for me to ſcrue it a Pin higher, and render it abſolute. If the Sectaries carry the Prize, (and who knows but it may be ſo, for Fortune favours mad Men) their Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy will quickly make the Nations weary, and pave the Way for my Reſtoration: for the Presbyterians, who are for a National Church, will never be quiet under a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Frame; and being alſo, as I have ſaid, for a King in their Principles, which are two main Heads of Agreement betwixt them and the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-men, they will quickly prove too ſtrong for the divided Sectaries, who diſagree in their Models both for Church and State.</p>
               <p>My Deſign, it's true, may ſeem Inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but there are Precedents which I am not aſham'd to follow: My Grandfather, King <hi>James,</hi> was ſworn to maintain the Church and State of <hi>Scotland</hi> as he found them, but yet made conſiderable Alterations in both. My Father was obliged by his Coronation-Oath, to govern according to the Laws, and yet did advance his Prerogative above them. My Grandfather, <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>IVth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> diſſembled both with his Proteſtant and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Subjects, and yet his Reign is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to Poſterity. But what need any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument; <hi>Did not the Council of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>determine that Faith is not to be kept
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98018:15"/> with Hereticks?</hi> Then why ſhould I ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a Cobweb-Objection, as the Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Oath to Proteſtants, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have now ſuch an Opportunity as, if loſt, can never be regain'd? The Engliſh are already fallen off to a Commonwealth, and the Scots, if I do not accept of their Terms, will quickly ſend me ſuch a Meſſage as they ſent my Father, That if he did not think it worth his while to come to <hi>Scotland</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Crown, they might perhaps be inclin'd to make choice of another Soveraign. The Roman Catholicks, and Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>-men, I am ſure of; and the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans I may be ſure of, if I comply with their Meaſures; ſo that it is beſt ſtriking the Iron while it is hot, and taking them by the Hand while I may, leſt my Friends be diſpirited by their long-waiting, and my Enemies be ſtrengthned by their uninterrupted Career.</p>
               <p>But alas! how am I diſappointed; the Scots are not ſo eaſily to be cheated, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my Solemn and Publick Declaration, that I accept of the Crown on the Terms which they propoſe without Equivocation or Mental Reſerve; ſo that I muſt be obliged to renounce my beſt Friends, the Catholicks and Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-men; and not only ſo, but alſo to root out what they think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent both upon themſelves and me to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98018:16"/> maintain. Ah miſerable Strait! but yet I have found a way to eſcape. The Roman Catholick Princes are acquainted with my Heart; and for others, I am not obliged to perform what I ſwear to them. The Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Council I have for me already, and it will be no great Difficulty to obtain a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from the Pope: And if I ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards break to the Presbyterians, I am certain of Abſolution from the Biſhops, ſome of them having already ſignified to me, that an Oath forc'd upon me, is not to be kept, eſpecially when it obliges me to extirpate their Order, which is <hi>Jure Divino</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Church. And if the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſhould know that I were under a Vow to maintain the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they would tell me I were abſolv'd by the Unlawfulneſs of the Matter: So that ſeeing every one of them will allow me to break to their Adverſaries, I may allow my ſelf to break with them all. And whereas each Party would ſecure their own Intereſt with me, why ſhould not all their Intereſts truckle to mine. The Kings of the Jews commanded their Prieſts, and why ſhould a Chriſtian Prince be their Subject? Let me once be but firmly eſtabliſh'd on the Throne, and then Kingcraft and Prieſtcraft ſhall have a Trial of Skill; and if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98018:16"/> agree about the Methods of ſaving their Souls, they may leave it to me how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Bodies. Let the Doctors diſpute their probable Opinions, and I will follow my Senſe and Intereſt. There's no more of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that is needful to a Prince, than what ſerves to give Credit to his Affairs. The Catholicks entitle me, <hi>Defender of the Faith;</hi> and the Biſhops do ſwear that I am <hi>Head of their Church:</hi> If the former offend me, they loſe my Protection; and if I be <hi>Head</hi> of the latter, the Tail muſt follow; and then I ſhall puniſh the Round-heads with its Sting.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, I am obliged to declare my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned and voluntary Aſſent to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but that is alſo the Effect of Force, and who is't that would not do ſo much for a Crown? If ever there were a Caſe wherein it was lawful to prevaricate, it's that of an Injured Prince to recover his Right. If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did lie to ſave his Life, why may not I do it to recover my Throne? And if <hi>Peter,</hi> who abjur'd his Saviour, was pardoned, there can be no Cauſe for me to deſpair? But what need is there of all this Debate? if my Works cannot merit, yet my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues may purchaſe Heaven, if Soul-Maſſes and Pious Legacies have any effect.</p>

               <p>I Have now weathered the Point ſo far as to obtain the Crown in ſpite of the declared War of one Part, and the Jealouſies of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part of my Subjects; and, like a good Pilot, have kept a ſteady Courſe betwixt the Gulphs of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis;</hi> but, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens bleſs me! with what a great deal of Danger! Having now compaſſed my End, it remains that I contrive how I may hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly break thoſe Fetters which the Scots have laid upon me. I have Topicks enow from whence to argue: I am now in Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Native Right, which in Juſtice they could not have kept me from. It's but reaſonable therefore I make them ſenſible, by Degrees, that I can lawfully ſhake off their Uſurpation. They have no Right to impoſe Terms upon the Crown, which is mine by Birth. Nor am I more obliged to keep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with them than with Robbers that ſhould aſſault me on the High-way, and force
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98018:18"/> me to ſuch and ſuch Oaths to ſave my Life. I do not hold my Crown by the Tenour of their Covenant, but as being deſcended from <hi>Fergus</hi>'s Loins. And if they reproach me with having uſed unjuſt Methods to obtain it, it's no more than what they did to keep me from it; but now when I have it, I am free from all Attainders, and reſponſible on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God alone. This was the Doctrine of my Father's Chaplains, and this will be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Old Cavaliers, <hi>whom I muſt now bring into Play as I can:</hi> It's true I have ſome Pangs of Conſcience for having appeal'd ſo ſolemnly to God Almighty, that I was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in my Intentions, and meant as I ſpoke, and ſo much the more, that on being inveſted with the ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Regalia,</hi> I was obliged to renew my Oath in the Sight and Hearing of the People. Nor was it without ſome Horror that I heard my Chaplain Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi> inſiſt upon the Guilt of my Family, the Duty of a King, and my Obligation by the preſent Oath; when I conſider'd my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Engagements to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the old Cavaliers, and exil'd Biſhops, to take Care of their Intereſt at my Reſtoration. But thoſe Qualms I conceive to be the Reſult of Opinion, which is fix'd in our Minds by the common Repreſentations of the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a Procedure, which I am the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98018:18"/> rather confirm'd in, becauſe the Frequency of the Act takes off that Apprehenſion of the Guilt which at firſt Commiſſion does ſtare one in the Face.</p>

               <p>AS I conceiv'd, ſo hath it happened; the Scots Presbyterians are all in pieces; thoſe that are rigid did at firſt ſuſpect me, and now they have begun to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and inſinuate already my Breach of Covenant. They are very ſharp-ſighted, but I muſt outwit them. Their Clergy are not all of a piece; thoſe who are ſtricteſt I muſt declare againſt, and fall in with that Party which is moſt complaiſant: If I can but once prevail with them to yield in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, they'l comply with me more and more by Degrees. The Uſurper <hi>Oliver</hi> being now in their Country, I muſt improve the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. The Nobility are eaſy to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that a Commonwealth will totally ruine their Honour: The Clergy are mortal Haters of Independency; and the People have an old Grudge againſt the Engliſh; ſo that it will be eaſier to unite them, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Enemy, than to bring them to a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98018:19"/> good Opinion of my Government. But as when a Ship is in Hazard, all Hands are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſave her, I have found it eaſy to perſwade the moderate Presbyterians <hi>to admit my Friends to Places of Power and Truſt, to aſſiſt againſt the Common Enemy:</hi> And then if there be no Probability for me to conquer, I ſhall be in a better Capacity to deſtroy. And when the Presbyterians are totally ſubdued, I ſhall be the better able to deal with the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents: And thoſe of the Scots Clergy, who comply with my Deſigns in reference to the State, will alſo at length come to be of my Sentiments, as touching the Church; for I can already perceive that the Favours of the Court, and Hopes of Preferment, do dazle their Eyes. And as for the Puritanical Sect call'd <hi>Remonſtrators,</hi> I will blacken their Fame by the Imputation of Rebellion, and make them odious to the Country, as Complyers with the Engliſh; for which end I will ſuborn ſome of my Friends who ſhall put the Notion in their Heads, to begin a Correſpondence, and then accuſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O! all ye Holy Apoſtles, and thou St.</hi> Peter, <hi>who art their Prince, pray for a Bleſſing on my Endeavours: Your Succeſſors teach me, that there is no Means unlawful which can be made uſe of for the Benefit of the Roman Catholick

The Presbyterians ſay they are puniſh'd for my Breach of Covenant, and I look upon it as the Merits of their old Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty; ſuch an eaſy Matter is it to turn thoſe Occurrences as the Proteſtants do their Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, like a Noſe of Wax. Nor does this Diſaſter ſo much affect my Throne, as it does diſgrace their own ſolemn League. Nor does it ſo much diſhearten my Friends, as it will certainly divide theirs: and while Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery and Independency ſtrive for the Maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Crown and the Mitre may play their Game. If the Defeat be aſcribed to the ill Conduct of the Presbyterians, as I ſhall be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98018:20"/> induſtrious to have it believ'd, it will open a wider Door for the Advancement of my Friends, as fitter for Conduct and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

               <p>THE Scots have ſhew'd their Affection to me, but Heaven thinks fit to blaſt their Endeavours. Nor is it poſſible for a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf to ſtand. The hot-headed Zealots aſcribe it to my own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, with my Father's Tyranny, and my Mother's Idolatry: But I rather think that the Curſe due to Rebels hath ſeiz'd on them, and that the Blood of my Father is required at their Hands, who were the firſt that durſt oppoſe him. How remarkable is that Juſtice which brings thoſe very Men againſt them, whom formerly they themſelves did aſſiſt againſt him? and that the Covenant on which they founded their Security ſhould now be made the chief Ground of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel? and that thoſe very Men to whom they ſold their Soveraign, ſhould now ſell their People, by hundreds, for Slaves? But thoſe Reflections I muſt keep to my ſelf; and ſo long as I have need of them, muſt flatter the Scots, who are now reſolved to invade <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98018:21"/> and to model me an Army more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my Mind: and then ſhall I ſee if my Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Friends will own me in Adverſity, as they did my Father in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and ſo long as he was able to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and protect them: And if they do not, as I ſuſpect that they will not, becauſe moſt of them comply with the Currant of the Time, it will alſo juſtify my Breach to them, if ever the Fates reſtore me to my Throne.</p>
               <p>I have now again a conſiderable Army, and pretty well purg'd from Puritanical Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; but ſtill I muſt pretend a Zeal for the Covenant, to pleaſe the Temper of the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Nation, and blunt the Darts which are thrown at me by the Presbyterian Remen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators; but when we are in <hi>England,</hi> I know what to do, and how to diſtinguiſh my Friends from my Foes: The Catholicks and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhall have the faireſt Quarter, though I muſt ſtill pretend Friendſhip to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians there, if it were for no other end but to make <hi>Oliver</hi> jealous of them, and becauſe ſome of them are very popular Men, and teſtify'd their Diſſatisfaction at my Father's Murder.</p>

               <p>HOW changeable are all humane Affairs, and how little is Grandeur and Strength to be relied on? I, who not long ago was crown'd with extraordinary Pomp, am now in a worſe Condition than the meaneſt Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98018:22"/> The other Day I was at the Head of a gallant Army, and now there's not a Man dare be ſeen to follow me: I was lately guarded by a Foreſt of Spears, and now I am glad to ſculk in a Foreſt of Trees. O! how does this Diſaſter wound my Soul? that I who was lately a King over Men, am now expoſed to wander among Beaſts, and in ſo much a worſe Condition than they, that I cannot ſo well provide for my ſelf? How do my Enemies now triumph? and what a dreadful Slaughter have they made of my Friends? I was proud of having an Army modelled to my mind, and to be at the Head of ſo many Cavaliers. How will the Scots Remonſtrators, to whoſe ill Conduct I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd my former Defeats, reproach me now with the Conduct of my own, ſo many of whom are killed in the and others will be butcher'd like Beaſts in the Shambles? Alas! this Defeat is more fatal to me than thoſe at <hi>Dumbar</hi> and <hi>Innerkeithing:</hi> The Presbyterians, whoſe Loſs I did not regard, will now ſay, that Juſtice has found me out, by cutting off thoſe who were the Pillars of my Hope. How often ſhall I be upbraided with it, that I am diſappointed by thoſe whom I preferred to them? Alas! what can I anſwer? That I had ſcarce ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of my Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> as I had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98018:23"/> thouſands of thoſe from <hi>Scotland:</hi> That they ſhould have march'd ſo far into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and be joined by ſuch an inconſiderable Handful: That ſo many thouſands of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters ſhould follow me into this Nation, where the Churchmen are ſtrongeſt, and yet ſo few of the Churchmen did join me; <hi>ſo that I came to my own, and they received me not.</hi> In truth, this Presbyterian Reflection has ſomething in it, that the Churchmen do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Kings for the Loaves, and always worſhip the Riſing Sun. Poor Souls! how many of the Covenanters have their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments roll'd in Blood, for eſpouſing my Cauſe, though their whole Party ſuſpects me? And how few of my Engliſh Epiſcopal Friends have either aſſiſted me with Men or Money? How do the Sectaries revile the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as Friends to me, becauſe Haters of their Anarchy? And yet how little do I hear of the Zeal of the Churchmen, who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretended to adore the Monarchy? How true have I found it, that their Loyalty to the Crown was meaſur'd by its Ability to protect the Mitre? No wonder that they followed and ſtood by my Father, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the War in Defence of them; but now that I muſt not declare for their Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, I perceive a Declenſion in their Zeal for the Monarchy; but if ever I happen to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98018:23"/> recover my Crown, then I ſhall be ſure to have their Friendſhip. And of the ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Eccleſiaſticks that are ſaid to be in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the far greater part will ſtill keep their Churches, as well as the Majority do now comply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deliver me, O thou Almighty! from my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Dangers. Thou who art King of Kings, defend me from thoſe Blood-thirſty Men who have murdered one King, and hunt after the Life of another. Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, then why ſhould they call me to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? Deliver me from their Hands, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate thy own Prerogative from thoſe who have uſurped thine as well as mine. When my pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friends forſake me, yet do thou eſpouſe my Cauſe.

                  <p>I have now the Satisfaction of ſome ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Company, whereas before I was immured amongſt Clowns: Now here's a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Gentleman, and a Peer, a ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of all the three States with whom I may ſafely adviſe how to retire; ſo that in the midſt of my Affliction God hath aſſwaged my Grief. Here I find a more convenient Subſiſtance, and can take ſome Repoſe for my wearied Limbs, till my galled Feet, which are not uſed to travel, may grow whole again, and fit for another Journey.</p>
                  <p>But alas! how variable is the Wheel of Fortune? and how quickly is all my Joy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98018:29"/> over-clouded; I thought I had found a ſecure Place to hide in, but the Malice of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies purſues me throughout.

               <p>HOW changeable are the Capricio's of that Teaſty Goddeſs called <hi>Fortune?</hi> I who entred the Kingdom not long ago with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98018:33"/> a formidable Army, am now in a ſtrait how to get out of it with one or two in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: But though the Goddeſs of Wiſdom be none of my Friend, yet the Goddeſs of Love continues propitious. It's true, I am obliged to part with one Female Protectreſs, to whom I hitherto owe my Life, but kind Heaven hath ſent me another; ſo that I find the fair Sex to be more inclinable to my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment than the Males.</p>
               <p>How great is the Difference betwixt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Adverſity? My Predeceſſors could have Fleets to attend them at Command, and I cannot have a ſingle Bark to tranſport me for hire. My Commands which ought to be obeyed by thouſands of Men, are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled by a ſingle Woman; nor dare I ſo much as diſpute her Authority. Here's a ſmall Emblem of my own Condition, for ſhe who ought to obey does now command, and has her Husband not only upon but under the Lock. The whole Nation is infected with the Rebellion, for a Man is not now the Maſter of his Family, but muſt be forc'd to ſubmit to the Command of his Wife, ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is the Example of a People's uſurping it over their Soveraign; and thus is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion plagu'd for its Rebellion.</p>

               <p>THAT I might the better avoid the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my Subjects, I deſign'd to have committed my ſelf to the Mercy of the Waves, as thinking it ſafer to be in a Storm at Sea, than in the middle of a raging Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion by Land; but the Fates think it fit to ſuſpend my Deſigns. I am environ'd by thoſe who ſeek after my Life, and forc'd to lodg with them under the ſame Roof, but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath pav'd the Way for my Eſcape, and by their Impurity provided for my Safety; ſo that inſtead of their having time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after me, the Pariſh is come to enquire after them, that they may not be at the Charge of their ſpurious Brats.

               <p>HOW great is the Change from a King who ought to command, to become a Supplicant that muſt beg.

My Predeceſſors had Navies to invade <hi>France</hi> at pleaſure, and I have not ſo much as a Fiſher-boat to carry me thither from Danger, but muſt both pay, and be obliged to thoſe that will be hired.</p>
               <p>They that are eminent in Dignity, ought to be ſo in Merit, elſe they can hardly eſcape being undiſcovered in their Adverſity. It's almoſt as hard for a Prince to be concealed in a Diſguiſe, as for the Sun to be hid with a tranſparent Cloud: I was not long ago at the Mercy of a Butler, and muſt now be obliged to the Fidelity of an Inn-keeper; and how
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98018:35"/> dangerous is it to truſt to thoſe who muſt live by Gain, when then they might have 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to diſcover my Perſon.</p>
               <p>The tumbling of the Waves reſembles the Inſtability of the Mob, who cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to day, and <hi>crucify</hi> to morrow. When the Sky is ſerene, the Surface is ſmooth; but when Storms ariſe, they threaten both Heaven and Hell.

               <p>MY Friends, if divided, can't give me that Aſſiſtance which I am ſure they might do if they were united, and therefore it's my Intereſt to have that effected. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances do ſpecify Actions, of which this is a remarkable Inſtance: If I were upon my Throne, and in full Proſperity, it would be my Advantage to pour Oil into the Flames, that by their mutual Diviſions I might tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over both, and make good my Title to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> but now that their Help is my only Refuge, I muſt endeavour an Accommodation.

What vain things are Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Honour, without the Subſtance of Riches and Power! But if I be unſucceſsful in Royal Amours, I have not been ſo in thoſe which are meaner, and can ſatisfy <hi>Nature,</hi> though not my <hi>Grandeur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Loyal Subjects being unable to defend me; and the French King, though my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, unwilling to ſuſtain me, I muſt now have recourſe to inferiour Princes, whom, if I had my Right, I ſhould be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but now muſt be obliged to court their Aſſiſtance, and quit part of my own Title for a Reward. How hard is my Condition? that I ſhould be reduced to call other Princes the Protector of my Subjects, and with the Addition of Royal, which would denote their Independance. But why may not they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them as well as me, and injoy the Name as well as perform the Thing? It's true, my rebellious Subjects will ſay, that my making Application to Catholick Princes, and not to Proteſtants, is a ſhrewd Cauſe to ſuſpect my Religion; but I muſt conſult my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98018:38"/> and not their Humours. Thoſe of them who are the firmeſt Proteſtants are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready either jealous of me, or have avowedly declar'd againſt me; and for the Pillars of thoſe who call themſelves by the Name of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they are already pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to my Reconciliation to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they don't much diſapprove, becauſe I feed them with Hopes of bringing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to an Accommodation with them; and ſhe will certainly do it, that ſhe may the better animate them againſt the Puritans, who being the moſt obſtinate of all the Hereticks, if they were once out of the way, the reſt will the more eaſily be brought to comply: for I perceive my Epiſcopal Friends do ſtill believe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, and the other Party to be none; and therefore a Reconciliation will be more eaſy with the former than the latter, eſpecially conſidering how near they approach in Diſcipline and Ceremonies to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Advances which Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Party made towards their Mother-Church alſo in Doctrine, will be a great ſtep towards the deſired Union; but that which will chiefly contribute thereunto is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Hatred which my Grandfather and Father did always take care to nouriſh in thoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98018:39"/> Puritans, which is now increas'd by the late overturning of their Hierarchy: ſo that if ever I be reſtor'd, the one will infallibly aſſiſt me to deſtroy the other; and when the Deſtruction of the Round-heads is effected, and my Father's Blood at the ſame time ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently reveng'd, I ſhall next take the other Party to task; and ſeeing it is not Principle but Intereſt which keeps them from comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I'l uſe my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to have it accompliſhed, or by—the Church, or at leaſt the hotteſt of them, ſhall ſmart for it: and thus I ſhall revenge my ſelf on them too, for playing the Poltroon, and ſotting in Taverns, while my Father was led to Execution, and declining to join my ſelf when I entred <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>

One might have reaſonably thought that I had received ſo many Affronts from my own People, that I ſhould never have been enamour'd on any of them; but, to my ſad Experience, I find it otherwiſe, and that <hi>Cupid</hi> tyrannizes over Kings as well as others, and commands us as imperiouſly as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, with a <hi>ſic volo ſic jubeo.</hi> Alas! that Love is Proof againſt all Cures, and that I cannot oblige it to withdraw at my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which I find it entertains with as much Diſdain as the Waves of the Sea did
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98018:40"/> thoſe of my Predeceſſor, who ſmote them with his Scepter, and forbad them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his Chair. Thus I who might be courted by the greateſt of Foreigners, muſt languiſh in love for one of my Subjects, as if the Fates had decreed both Sexes of them an abſolute Conqueſt over me.</p>
               <p>If I marry her, I am ſure to loſe my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; and if I do it not, I muſt ſacrifice my Content, for her Vertue I find altogether inſuperable: I muſt therefore comply with my Brother <hi>James</hi>'s Advice, and marry her privately before him and a Prieſt; and thus I may conſult my preſent Repoſe, and take my meaſures in time to come by future Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
               <p>Nor am I like to be leſs unfortunate in the Quality of my own Match, than alſo in my Allies, by that of my Brother, who is catch'd in the like Snare; but who can reſiſt the Charms of Love?

               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:98018:41"/>
               <p>Bleſs me! how ſtrange a thing is it that the Arms of a traiterous Subject ſhould be able not only to expel me from my own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, but diſturb my Repoſe in thoſe of others? and how diſhonourable and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is it for one Monarch to countenance Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt another? But why ſhould I ſay thus? it is juſt with Princes as it is with the Pope, he would impoſe his Infallibility upon others, when he does not believe one word of it himſelf: So we would have our own Subjects to obey us without Reſerve, as being obliged by God ſo to do; and yet we countenance the Rebellions of one another's Subjects. Thus did my Father make a ſhew at leaſt of countenancing the French Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots againſt their natural Soveraign. My Grandfather, King <hi>James,</hi> though a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of Kingcraft, did, in ſome ſort, eſpouſe the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi>'s Quarrel againſt his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign the Emperor: And my Predeceſſor Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſupported the <hi>Netherlands</hi> in their Rebellion againſt the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> So that in ſhort, my Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may boaſt of their Loyalty what they pleaſe, but I think they have very ſmall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for they that make no Scruple to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Rebellion of others, will make no Conſcience of rebelling themſelves, if ever they have occaſion. And thus, if there

               <p>But it's in vain to diſpute, the Fates have decreed it, and I muſt obey; ſo that rather than be ſent from this Kingdom with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, or any publick Remark, I'l abandon it willingly of my own Accord, and ſave my Honour as much as I can.</p>

               <p>Nor is it the French King alone who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes my Deſigns, but my Mother, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, has a hand in the pie, though I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhe is miſled by an Overcharge of Zeal.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98018:43"/> himſelf of that Church; an Evidence that ſhe had but little regard to my Father while alive, when ſhe tramples ſo avowedly upon his Commands now that he's dead; if the Εικον Βασιλικε was truly his, wherein he not only adviſes me againſt any Change of my Religion, but all the reſt of his Children: and though it's true that I have changed mine in Obedience to a higher Command, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Chriſt's Succeſſor upon Earth, and for the advancing of my own Intereſt; yet it is not publickly known, and by Conſequence is not ſcandalous; but for my Mother thus openly to ſcandalize the World by influencing my Brother to an avowed Breach of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Commands, is no ſutable Return for that laſt Meſſage <hi>which he ſent her, that his Thoughts had never ſtrayed from her:</hi> So that either ſhe muſt not believe that Book to be his, or is very impolitick to take ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. However I will make the beſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it I can, and ſend for him away from under her Conduct, which will be a good Argument for my Friends in <hi>England</hi> to prove that I am firm in my Religion; and I will endeavour to perſwade her that I do it out of Policy, becauſe I would not come to a Rupture with her.</p>

The Loſs of this Battel does mightily affect me; ſo many of my beſt Friends having done their utmoſt to retrieve our loſt Cauſe in it, but in vain; and my two Brethren commanding in Perſon, have alſo been made ſenſible of the Frowns of Fortune; ſo that the whole Family will be henceforth eſteem'd unſucceſsful: and what dangerous Conſequences attend ſuch an Opinion of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, Experience hath taught in all Ages. There happened nothing favourable in this Rencounter, but that my Brother <hi>James</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, had the good Fortune to eſcape: Whence I have ſome ground to hope that we are preſerved for better Times: and though Fortune at preſent favours <hi>Oliver,</hi> ſo that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98018:45"/> neither Scots, Dutch nor Spaniards can ſtand before him, the Caſe will not always conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue thus, but the Wheel may turn upon him or his. My Subjects begin already to be weary of the Anarchy in the State; and the Presbyterians themſelves of the Confuſion in the Church: The Nobility and Gentry are angry to be trod under-foot by his Officers, who are Fellows of inferiour Quality: And by their deſiring him to take upon him the Title of King, it ſhows that they have no Diſlike to the Office; and being ſenſible of his Breach of his Oath, by taking the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon himſelf, though a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, modelling their Parliaments as he pleaſes, though he was ſworn to maintain their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and governing them by an Army, though he would not allow my Father the Militia; they'l quickly come to draw ſuch Inferences, that ſeeing we muſt be tyranniz'd over, it were as good to be ſo by thoſe who have a long time been in poſſeſſion of the Throne, and will take care to leave ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth the Enjoyment of their Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeeing they believe the Divine Right of a Lineal Succeſſion: whereas they who have no ſuch Principle nor Pretence, do only take care for themſelves, and make Hay while the Sun ſhines.</p>

XXV.</hi> On his Majeſty's being invited to a Treaty on the Frontiers of <hi>Spain,</hi> betwixt the French and Spaniſh Miniſters, about a Peace betwixt thoſe Crowns: Sir <hi>George Booth's</hi> Defeat: The Confuſions which the Nations were caſt into by <hi>Lambert,</hi> and General <hi>Monk</hi>'s car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Deſigns of reſtoring his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</head>
               <p>FOrtune begins now to look upon me with a more favourable Aſpect, when the Great Potentates of <hi>Europe</hi> court me to be preſent at a Treaty of Peace; which, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, may tend to my Reſtoration, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being obliged to my own Subjects; and then I may introduce the Catholick Religion in an open manner, as the Condition of the Aſſiſtance which is granted to me by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes.</p>
               <p>But, alas! the malign Influences of my Stars are not yet exhauſted, for the Treaty is turn'd only to a Ceſſation of Arms; the French are very cold in their Careſſes, and the Spaniards have only granted me ſome Complimental Honours.</p>
               <p>Nor have I been more ſucceſsful in my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98018:47"/> Indeavours, Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are defeated; ſo that I find the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians were more ſucceſsful againſt my Father than ever they have been ſince for him or me. And the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-men, though they will expect to reap the greateſt Benefit from my Reſtoration, are very ſlack in their Endeavours towards it.</p>
               <p>The only thing which looks with a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Aſpect, as to my Affairs, is, that the Nations are madded with ſo many Changes of Government, and always ſubjected to the Tyranny of the Army: Their Parliaments, the Conſervation of whoſe Privileges had a great ſhare in beginning the War, are alſo trampled under foot, which I know muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly diſguſt the People.</p>
               <p>The main Anchor of my Hopes is General <hi>Monk,</hi> whom I muſt careſs with great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to carry on my Deſigns, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being zealous againſt me, till ſuch time as he may ſafely declare himſelf for me.</p>
               <p>The Scots, I know, are weary of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Uſurpation, and many of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians there do ſtill think that I am their Friend; ſo that it will be eaſy for him to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my Intereſt in that Nation; and while he ſummons their Gentry to abjure me by the Tender, he may form the Plot for my Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

               <p>NOW Fortune is ſurely ſated with my Miſeries, and inſtead of her Frowns vouchſafes me her Smiles: My Deſigns at length have prov'd ſucceſsful, and now I am mounting to the Top of the Wheel; but that Lady is ſo fickle and unconſtant, that I muſt be careful of the Meaſures which I take, and give my Subjects kind Words now, if I would have them to be my Servants for ever. The Engliſh Loyalty is purer than that of the Scots, who demanded much harder Terms from me; and ſeeing I ſwore the greater, I may very well promiſe the leſſer, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to keep them both alike. And ſeeing the Puritans complain'd of being perſecuted in my Father's Reign, I muſt promiſe an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to tender Conſciences: and, in ſhort, take all poſſible Methods to ſweeten my Subjects, till ſuch time as I be ſettled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, and then I ſhall puniſh the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98018:48"/> ſtubborn Schiſmaticks with a Vengeance for their old Rebellion. But I muſt be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and counterfeit a deal of Piety before the Puritanical Parſons who are ſent over to me: I muſt prepare ſome Prayers in their own canting Dialect, and order them to be brought where they may hear me at them in my Cloſet; and for once I'll imitate <hi>Oliver,</hi> who uſed always to pray with an audible Voice, by which he drew his Followers into a great Opinion of his Piety. He's a curſed Pattern indeed, but according to the Proverb, <hi>Fas eſt &amp; ab hoſte doceri:</hi> And if I can but impoſe upon thoſe Leading Prieſts, the Cant will take univerſally amongſt the Party, and I ſhall carry on my Deſigns with the more Facility. It's true, that according to the common Notion of the World this may ſeem Atheiſtical; but ſeeing the Catholick Church will avouch that Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, it cannot be unlawful for me to diſſemble with them; and if there be a God, he is not certainly ſuch as we have him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, elſe he had never pav'd my Way to the Throne, ſeeing he muſt know that I never deſign'd to keep one Word of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: ſo that I have no reaſon to ſuffer any Diſquiet in my Thoughts upon that account; for when thoſe who call themſelves Divines, and make it their Trade, cannot agree whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98018:49"/> there be only one God and no Perſons, or one God and three Perſons; nor yet as to the Rule which he hath left to direct us, nor the Meaning of that which ſome of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the Rule; let meaner Perſons trouble themſelves about theſe Speculations, I'll concern my ſelf how to live like a King. And ſeeing in their own Dialect they call me a God upon Earth, they ſhall obey my Will as the Vice-gerent of Heaven. And ſince it is uncertain whether there be either a God or a Heaven, I'll eaſe my ſelf of the Trouble of my Prayers for time to come, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done for ſome time paſt; and yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that my Affairs go on and proſper, while theirs, who do not only pray, but alſo howl and whine, are on the Declenſion; and certainly their God muſt be a very unkind Soveraign, to ſuffer the beſt of his Subjects, for ſo they muſt be if the Bible be his Word, to lie under the greateſt Affliction. Surely I would not do ſo to the beſt of my Subjects if I could help it; but if they be ſuch Fools as to think that Afflictions make them the fitter for Heaven, <hi>qui decipi vult decipiatur,</hi> for my part, if I can, I'll take my pleaſure here, and venture upon what is to come hereafter.</p>
               <p>There is ſtill one dangerous Rock more on which I muſt beware of ſplitting, and that is, leſt the People be jealous of my Deſigns on
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98018:49"/> their Civil Liberties; for let them clamour and talk of Religion as much as they will, I find that to be pinch'd in the other is their principal Grievance; ſo that Stiffneſs in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a thing peculiar to the Scots Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians and their bigotted Followers: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I muſt be high in my Proteſtations, that there is nothing which I do ſo much lay to heart, as the Advancement of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Conſervation of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of Parliament; that all the Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which I and mine have met with from Proteſtants, have not been able to alter my Opinion, as to the former; nor have all the Invaſions which they have made upon my Prerogative, been able to put me out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit with the latter; but that I ſhall always look upon their Counſel as the beſt, and be ready to comply with ſuch Meaſures as they propoſe for the Advancement of Religion and Liberty.</p>

               <p>MY Deſigns have taken, and my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are thereupon returned to their Duty; ſo that now I am recall'd by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Nation, who were wearied by the Oppreſſions of the late Anarchy. I may now with Safety put off my Vizard in ſome meaſure, and ſay with Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. that it's needleſs to ſtoop any longer now that I have found the Keys. The People, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, are come to a high Flight of Loyalty; ſo that my ſmall Eſcapes will not be taken notice of: And ſeeing all this Solemnity is for me, why ſhould not I chiefly reap the Sweets of it? If the Subjects indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as to Wine and Women, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, why ſhould the ſame be denied to their Soveraign? The beſt way to carry on my Deſigns is to begin my Reign with Jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which will be grateful to thoſe who have been ſo long reſtrain'd from Liberty. By this means I ſhall be ſure to have the ſtrongeſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98018:50"/> Party; for all Mens natural Inclinations, which the Preciſians call Luſts and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will be certainly for me; and if once they get a Vent, will break out like an Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation now that they have ſo long been under a Reſtraint. The youthful Nobility and Gentry will certainly adore my Reign on this account, as Auguſt and Splendid; and the Churchmen will be glad to be from under the Checks and Grimaces of the Puritans: ſo that the Whole being immers'd in Jollity and Pleaſure, they'l quickly leave off the Cant of Religion and Property; and they who do otherwiſe, will be made the Subject of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ignominy.</p>
               <p>Why may not I have the Counteſs of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlemain,</hi> as well as <hi>David</hi> had <hi>Bathſheba?</hi> The Solemnity of this Day is a much more excuſable Tentation than his viewing of a beautiful Woman from the top of his Houſe. If I be privately reproach'd, as having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded another Man's Property, I can tell them publickly, that Princes are not to be limited as private Men, they have a Right to the Perſons and Goods of their Subjects; and who ought to ſay to a King, <hi>What doſt thou?</hi> If I keep them from incroaching upon one another, they may very well allow me my Liberty: I am accountable to none but God, and him I will venture to take in my
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98018:51"/> own Hand; the Advancement of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church will atone for all other Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; ſo that as to this I have no reaſon to be ſollicitous; a good End will hallow the worſt of Means: and ſeeing thoſe who are called the debauchedſt of Men have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Pangs and Gripes of Conſcience, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs of Practice is the beſt Method of the World to reduce ſuch to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe Pardons may be had for the higheſt of Crimes; ſo that a Man may enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin, and not only be freed from the Puniſhment due to it, but alſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of Heaven at laſt. And herein the Pope does as much as <hi>Mahomet,</hi> though under a Vail of greater Modeſty, and ſecures to his Followers the Pleaſures both of this World and that which is to come: ſo that I ſhall take care by this Method to pave the way for the Return of Popery, and make it appear that Debauchery is look'd upon by me as the beſt Teſt of Loyalty, as indeed it will be; for ſure I am that Debauchees, as fooliſh Men call thoſe who indulge the innocent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of Nature, will never be Enemies to a Reign which allows them in it; but on the contrary, will be my ſureſt Defence againſt all the Attempts of the Puritanical Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</p>

               <p>NOW when the Kingdom is in a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Loyalty, I muſt take care to revenge my Father's Death, wherein I ſhall be ſure of the Concurrence of the Parliament, becauſe that ſame Hand which cut off his Head cut off their Privileges; but I muſt puſh it further than I'm afraid they will be willing, and by my Friends and Penſioners procure an Act for an Anniverſary Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of my Father's Murder, by which I ſhall blazon his Vertues to all Poſterity, and load his Enemies with the Height of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, which will mightily tend to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of my Prerogative; for by cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt his Murder, all manner of Oppoſition againſt Soveraigns will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd. I am ſure of having the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Aſſiſtance, becauſe thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him did alſo deſtroy them; ſo that they will certainly defend his Cauſe as their own; and the more that they extol my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the more they depreſs their own Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98018:52"/> ſo that I need not doubt but the Church-men will expreſs themſelves with all the Hyperboles imaginable, to diſplay the Horridneſs of the Murder, and the Piety and ſingular Vertues of <hi>their Martyr;</hi> which will be of ſpecial Uſe to ſupport my Pretenſions to an abſolute Monarchy: for when the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Pulpits ring with Declamations for Paſſive Obedience, it will create an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Abhorrence of all ſuch as are for any manner of Reſiſtance; which the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will find themſelves oblig'd to promote, that they may throw Dirt upon the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, who are Enemies to their Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. And thus by keeping the Proteſtants at Enmity amongſt themſelves, and the ſtiffeſt and moſt obſtinate amongſt them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hatches, I ſhall be the better enabled to deſtroy the whole, and bring in Popery by Degrees, if not by Head and Shoulders.</p>
               <p>But as to the Regicides, to have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned has been no hard matter, becauſe the Parliament did never approve of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and from their Condemnation I ſhall reap this Advantage, that the Means muſt fall under the ſame Cenſure with the Inſtruments; and all things which contributed to my Father's Death as a <hi>pretended Zeal for Religion, and the Privileges of the People,</hi> will be look'd upon as certain Marks of Diſloyalty.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> On his Majeſty's diſſolving the Parliament which called him in, and ſummoning another.</head>
               <p>THis Parliament hath done all that I am to expect from them, and therefore it's expedient that I ſhould diſſolve them, it not being ſafe to truſt too much to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that has ſuch an Alloy: I muſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon another, which will be fitter for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and bring in as many of my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Exile as I can: Their Spirits are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter'd by their former Sufferings, and their Purſes are ſtill ſenſible of their Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which will make them the more eager for a Revenge; and to help it on, I will ſtill keep them low, and feed them with Promiſes to carry on my Deſigns. I muſt now begin to think of my Engagements to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; and towards the better accompliſhing of them, muſt reſtore the Biſhops, which I can eaſily do now that the Houſe is fill'd with my Friends, who will be glad of ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon the Presbyterians. I have wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd the Point in other things of as great Conſequence, ſo that I need not deſpair of ſucceeding in this. Let the Scots Phanaticks
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98018:53"/> upbraid me with the Breach of Covenant, and the Engliſh Roundheads with my Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from <hi>Breda,</hi> I am not concern'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſuch Trifles. The former was tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally impos'd both upon me and my Subjects; and the latter was only an Eſſay of Policy. When I was under Reſtraint I might abate of my Prerogative; but now that I am at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty I may as lawfully regain it, for I can never be diveſted of my native Right. They both ſay that I am God's Vice-gerent, and therefore if I part with my own Prerogative I part with his; but if I muſt follow my own Inclination, I had rather ſay with the noble <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him?</hi> And if the Puritans call themſelves <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> I'm reſolv'd to keep them in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; and though I don't allow them Straw, will exact the Tale of the Brick: I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as much Loyalty and Obedience from them, as from thoſe who have my Favour; and if I find them come ſhort, they ſhall be ſure to ſmart for it: They are a Company of idle Enthuſiaſts, and therefore ſay, <hi>Let us go ſerve the Lord;</hi> but they ſhall ſerve him in my way, or not at all. I have already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned their <hi>Babel</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or have rather indeed kept it under, as I found it, for <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> had pretty well humbled them to my hand; and inſtead of an Indulgence there
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98018:53"/> ſhall be a ſtrict Uniformity in <hi>England,</hi> which will ſet the Epiſcopal Party and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians together by the Ears; and then the Catholicks may take their Advantages to promote their Religion; and I ſhall improve the Opportunity to advance my Prerogative. When the Pulpits are once emptied of the Presbyterian Parſons, who preach up ſuch rigid Morals, I'll take care that the Biſhops ſhall not imploy Preciſians, but Men of a more courtly and complaiſant Temper, who will allow a greater Latitude both in Doctrine and Example, that the Church may have no reaſon to upbraid the Looſneſs of the Court. Nor ſhall I value the moroſs Reflections of Fanaticks upon my Principles and Practice, but contemn them as unworthy of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's Regard.</p>
               <p>I am happy in the Model of this preſent Parliament, for they have given me as much as I can at preſent deſire: they have made me an Offering of the Peoples Purſes, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Lives; have enacted ſuch Laws as will make one Proteſtant devour another, and do every thing according to my own Mind. How great is the Change betwixt mine and my Father's Days, when the Parliament thought they could never reſtrain him enough, and my Parliament think every thing too little for me. Thus the Triennial Act, which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98018:54"/> ſecur'd the Peoples Properties, and was with ſo much Struggling obtain'd from my Father, is now made a Sacrifice to my Prerogative, ſo that their chiefeſt Fortreſs is ſurrendred at once. They have not only provided for my living in Slpendor, but alſo taken care of my Reputation: And leſt ſome ſharp-ſighted Fellows ſhould perceive my Deſign of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Popery, they have forbid it to be ſpoken of on pain of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> though at the ſame time I be in actual Correſpondence with the Pope; ſo that I find my Penſions are well laid out; and though at preſent they be expenſive, yet they are but like the putting of a ſmall Quantity of Water into a Pump, to draw out an hundred times more.</p>

His Majeſty's appointing a Conference at the <hi>Savoy</hi> betwixt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts and Nonconformiſts; and influencing the Houſe of Commons to offer Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Toleration.</head>
               <p>DIvide and Command was <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s Maxim, and I find it very neceſſary for me to put in practice, that my Subjects may not unite againſt me as formerly againſt my Father. That I may the better revenge my Father's Death, and my own Injury upon the Puritans, I muſt find a way to make them be thought guilty of Plots againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which will be readily believ'd, becauſe they join'd with the Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Father, and look upon themſelves as oppreſs'd and betray'd by me; and I need not doubt of its being believ'd by thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are their irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable Enemies; for when the one is up, the other muſt go down: and then I ſhall reap this Advantage from it, that the Pulpits will thunder Invectives againſt them, and bring
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98018:55"/> the general Odium of the Nation upon them, by which ſome of them will be obliged to comply, which will create Diviſions amongſt their own Party. And ſome of the moderate Churchmen will be diſpleaſed at the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties uſed againſt the Presbyterians; and by this Means I ſhall break all the Proteſtants to pieces amongſt themſelves. To give my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation the Face, at leaſt, of Probability, I muſt take care to have treaſonable Letters lodged with their chief Patrons, for which Sir <hi>J. P.</hi> is a very fit Inſtrument. It will alſo be a very proper Method to ſuborn Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to talk of treaſonable Deſigns amongſt ſuch of them as are unwary; and if they cannot be indicted for High Treaſon, they may very well be purſued for Miſpriſion of Treaſon; and if they themſelves be brought to confeſs that they heard of ſuch Deſigns, others will believe that they had actually a hand in contriving them; and when once ſome of them are convicted by Publick Juſtice, and executed accordingly, it will confirm the Belief of a Plot, and ſtrike a Terror into the reſt.</p>
               <p>But that the State may not bear all the blame, I muſt bring in the Church for a ſhare; and though I appoint them by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to confer with the Nonconformiſts about Methods for a Comprehenſion, yet
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98018:55"/> they ſhall have private Inſtructions, not to comply: And that they may not at firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Deſign, I ſhall take care to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate that their conceding in one thing will occaſion all the reſt to be call'd in queſtion; and then by the Influence of the Biſhops in the Houſe of Lords, and of the Members of the Clergy's Choice in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, I ſhall bring it to paſs that the Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſhall fall into a general Diſgrace, and be reputed not only ſuch in Name, but in Deed, and not at all worthy of a Toleration; which I reckon the beſt Politicks that I can put in practice, to ruine the moſt zealous Profeſſors of the Proteſtant Religion firſt, and then the reſt will quickly be brought to comply with my Deſigns, and abandon that Religion of which they have little or nothing but the Name, or at leaſt render it odious and of ſmall Eſteem, by walking unanſwerably to its Principles. And if any cunning Fellow ſhall ſmell out my Deſign, I have provided againſt his daring to ſpeak of it by the Act againſt thoſe who ſhall declare me a Papiſt, or that I have a Deſign to introduce Popery: And though thoſe who are ſharp-ſighted may laugh at ſuch a Proviſion, as rather giving than taking away Cauſe of Suſpicion, yet when it dare not be openly talk'd of amongſt the Vulgar, it will not obtain a common Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98018:56"/> And the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whom I ſupport againſt the Phanaticks, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupport me againſt their Cenſures. And thus when I have made one Party of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to bait the other ſufficiently, if the Church of <hi>England</hi> prove refractory after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to my Deſigns, then I ſhall endeavour, by remitting the Rigour of the Law, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Diſſenters on my ſide, to favour an univerſal Toleration, by which my Friends the Papiſts may have eaſe, if the Epiſcopal Party begin to grudg at my Favours towards them, or to fear that at laſt they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs themſelves.</p>

               <p>THis I know will be cenſured as an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Action, and the ſhutting my ſelf out of the Continent, whereunto this Town opened a Door, by which I might have invaded <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands</hi> when I pleaſed. It's true that it was a Monument of <hi>England</hi>'s Glory, but ſuch an one as being erected under the Conduct of an Uſurper, is not for the Credit of me nor my Family;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98018:56"/> and therefore leſt it ſhould be an Allurement to re-intice my People to a Commonwealth, I will make it a Sacrifice to my Couſin the French King: Not that I owe ſo much to his Kindneſs, but that he may ſupply my preſent Neceſſities with his Money. And to teſtify my farther Reſentments of that impious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the Citadels which <hi>Oliver</hi> built ſhall be raz'd throughout my Dominions, and the Towns which held out againſt my Father diſmantled; and if it were not that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence would be fatal to my ſelf, every one of them ſhould be ſowed with Salt, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants made to paſs under Saws of Iron, and have their Fleſh torn with the Briars and Thorns of the Wilderneſs: But I muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend other Cauſes to the People, leſt they ſhould be enraged, as that I won't keep up Gariſons amongſt them, when there is no need to diſturb their Commerce, nor leave it in the Power of other Kings to do it, when the Places which are capable of being gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd are diſmantled: though in reality it is to prevent the Rebels from neſtling there, or having recourſe to them to favour their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the beſt way to be rid of the Harpies being to deſtroy their Neſts: And that I may free my ſelf at once, as much as is poſſible from that viperous Brood, as I have already disbanded the Army, under pretence that I
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98018:57"/> would not keep up one in time of Peace, but in reality becauſe I would not have ſuch a Body of well-diſciplin'd Troops of their Principles together, leſt at any time they ſhould make head againſt me as againſt their former Maſters, the <hi>Parliament, Richard,</hi> &amp;c. So now I'll forbid their old Officers to ſtay within 20 Miles of <hi>London,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of the Troops I'll ſend to fight againſt the Spaniards in my Wife's Quarrel; and if they never return, as I hope few of them will, I can very well bear the Loſs.</p>

Their Zeal to my Prerogative is regulated by their own Intereſt, which makes them oppoſe my Diſpenſing Power: So that I find I am only abſolute againſt Phanaticks and Republicans; but when I come to meddle with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> my Power is limited, and the Parliament muſt then be Sharers of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.

               </head>
               <p>I Find that I ſhall bring my Deſigns about by Degrees, and under the Notion of Plotters execute Vengeance upon mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, without incurring the Cenſure of being bloody or cruel. It's true that it may ſeem hard that I ſhould take the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Head, who was the Perſon that ſet the Crown upon my own: But during this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy of Loyalty, in which the Nations are at preſent, the Method of ſuch Proceedings will be the leſs taken notice of; and it's abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for my purpoſe that the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> ſhould be taken out of the way; the Greatneſs of his Power, and his Zeal for his Religion, may otherwiſe prove great Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments to my Deſigns: I have Pretences enough againſt him, becauſe of his Activity in the Parliament's Rebellion; and his Death will be acceptable to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:98018:58"/> becauſe he was Head of the Presbyterians; and the Friends of the late Marquiſs of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſſe,</hi> and all the Cavaliers, will concur with my Deſign againſt him; and though there is no doubt but that he will profeſs his Innocence on the Scaffold, yet the Authority of a publick Sentence will be of greater Weight, or at leaſt reſtrain the People from open Murmurings. By his Death I ſhall have alſo this farther Advantage, that the Power of his Clan will be thereby reduced, and neither be formidable to my ſelf nor Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, it being the Intereſt of all Crowns to guard againſt too potent Subjects. As to Sir <hi>Archibald Johnſton</hi> of <hi>Wariſton,</hi> though he be not ſo great in Power, yet he is nothing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the other in Policy, but indeed far above him: and as the Trojans ow'd their Deſtruction more to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi>'s Counſels than <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Arms, it's my Intereſt to rid my ſelf of a Politician, who is my Enemy, as ſoon as of one who is greater in Power and Quality. And though it be reckon'd no great Policy for a Monarch, newly re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, to cement his Throne with Blood, yet it is not only good Policy, but abſolutely needful, in my caſe, to ſacrifice the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders of the Presbyterians while they are at preſent under a Conſternation, before they have time to recollect their Spirits, and make
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98018:59"/> head againſt me; and therefore I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd on a Victim of each ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> of their Nobility, Gentry and Clergy; and ſo Mr. <hi>James Guthry,</hi> who hath appeared ſo ſtout for the Privileges of their Church, as being ſupreme Judg themſelves in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs, ſhall ſmart for his Opinion. And thus I will pave my way to the Enjoyment of my Prerogative, both in Affairs of Church and State, over the Bellies of my Enemies. Nor muſt it be in <hi>Scotland</hi> alone where the Effects of my Reſentments ſhall be felt, but in both my other Kingdoms, for I muſt take care to have the Apprehenſions of a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Party continued in all the three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; of which I ſhall make theſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that they will ſerve for a Ballance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> if ſhe grow ſtubborn, and always ſerve for a Pretence of a Neceſſity of keeping up Forces; and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of them to the Fury of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Party, will be at all times an effectual Means of draining their Pockets, and making them concur to the raiſing of Money in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: and when at any time I am minded to amuſe the People with the Noiſe of a Plot, it will be the more eaſily believed, ſeeing there is a Party, who being exaſperated with Oppreſſion, it may be reaſonably thought that they will endeavour to procure their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

               <p>LEST the Nation ſhould grow luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with too long Peace, it's ſit that I ſhould engage them in War abroad, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their having leiſure to tumultuate at home. Had my Father done ſo, he might have prevented his Diſaſter. I have Pretences enough of quarrelling with the Dutch, but if they be not thought weighty, I muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make them appear ſo. My Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which I have in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, will eaſily be influenc'd to find juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cauſes: And ſeeing the Nation are jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their Trade, as their principal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, to give out that the Dutch have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach'd upon that, will be moſt plauſible and taking; and the natural Hatred which the Epiſcopal Party have againſt the Dutch Presbytery, and Form of Government, will render them eaſy to believe the Crimes charged upon them, and make them concur with Zeal enough in their Deſtruction. And for the other Party, who will certainly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and gueſs at that which is the real Cauſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98018:60"/> of the War, it will afford me an Opportunity to treat them the more ſeverely, and juſtify the Rigour which ſhall be uſed towards them. And in the mean time I ſhall carry on the common Deſign of reſtoring the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under ſuch Colours as will not be eaſily diſcerned, it being indeed fit to raze out the Memory of that People from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, and not to leave ſuch a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſucceſsful Rebellion againſt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and the Catholick Church in Being. It's true that my Deſign may be tax'd with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, conſidering the kind Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I found amongſt them during my Exile: but as I have been happy in palliating my Treatment of the Spaniards, and the Scots Presbyterians, both of whom were very kind to me; I doubt not alſo to find Excuſes for this, which will in ſome meaſure ſatisfy the Publick.</p>

                  <p>The Poets are in the right when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Juſtice blindfold, for in good earneſt it ſeems that ſhe determines Cauſes by chance, and that the good things of this World are made for thoſe who can catch them: and if there be any ſuch thing as a Deity, it ſees not as Men ſee; nor does it act according to thoſe Rules which are in vogue amongſt us Mortals. The Dutch pretend to have that which they call Religion and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice on their ſide; and in truth if that which is eſteemed the Rule of both, be true, their Pretenſions are not ill founded, and yet the Victory hath fallen to me. Then ſeeing we are not certain what be the Rules and Decrees of the higher Powers, it's rational for Men to follow their own Inclinations, and gratify their natural Appetites as much as they can. The contrary Principle ſeems very unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98018:63"/> that we who look upon our ſelves as a happy Race of Creatures ſhould yet labour under a ſeverer Reſtraint; and that we ſhould be denied the pleaſing of what's viſible for the pretended Safety of ſome, I do not know what, inviſible Subſtance. But from this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory I ſhall be ſure of theſe following Fruits; In the firſt place that it will give Credit to my Arms, which have not hitherto been reckoned ſucceſsful; and in the next it will magnify my Brother's Conduct, which will ſtill contribute to render me the more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. It will alſo create Diſorders in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which may be improved to my great Advantage, and it will ſecure me from the Murmurs of the Rabble at home, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways meaſure the Juſtice of a Cauſe by its Succeſs; and it will be a prevailing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Parliament to go chearfully on with their promiſed Supplies.</p>
                  <p>But my Joys are neither long-liv'd nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd; for though I be Conqueror by the Sword, I'm conſum'd by the Plague, which rages in the Bowels of my Capital City. No doubt the Phanaticks will ſay that it is for the Sins of me and my Family; as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was plagu'd for <hi>David</hi>'s numbring of the People: but as my Subjects are not ſo well deſerving as his, I am not obliged to be ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd as he was; nor am I indeed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

But for the Reflection of the Phanaticks, I can eaſily turn it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that it's a juſt Puniſhment upon the Nation for their unnatural Rebellion, and the horrid Murder of their King and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and if this be once given out at Court, I am ſure it will be eccho'd again from the Pulpit: and as that will juſtify the utmoſt of my Severity in <hi>Scotland</hi> by free Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the Presbyterians there, it will alſo defend my Proceedings againſt their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>England,</hi> to keep them in Priſons at <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. till they die of the Contagion here: And as for my ſelf and my Court, we can remove to a Place of better Air. And though the Bills of Mortality do increaſe to a prodigy, it's a juſt Vengeance on the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious City: and if it come to the worſt, that I ſhould want Men to carry on the War, I can quickly make up a Peace abroad; and when my Subjects are diminiſhed, I am the leſs in hazard by a Rebellion at home.</p>

               <p>AS this City afforded a ſafe Retreat to my Father from his rebellious Subjects at <hi>London,</hi> it furniſhes me with the like du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Peſtilence which hath ſeiz'd upon that City for their Rebellion: And as the Londoners had Influence upon the then Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to increaſe their Obſtinacy, I doubt not but the Univerſity will have Influence upon this to heighten their Loyalty. My Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is now to applaud the Parliament for their adviſing me to a War with <hi>Holland,</hi> which hath hitherto been ſo ſucceſsful: And as it will convince them that I am willing to make them Sharers of my Glory, it will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them the more willing to make me a Sharer of their Purſes: But leſt thoſe amongſt them who are firm Proteſtants ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Deſign, and blame my Conduct for leaguing with Popiſh Princes to procure the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98018:65"/> Deſtruction of the Dutch, I muſt hide my Deſigns under a pretence of repaying them in their own Coin; and that my ſtirring up the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> againſt them, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they have given an ill Character of me to Foreign Proteſtant Princes: And conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that it was neceſſary for the Nation's Glory that thoſe ſtubborn Republicans, who had broke the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould be humbled by <hi>England,</hi> the Parliament have no reaſon to be angry at my ſupplying the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> with Money. And at the ſame time I will pretend that I am willing to come to a Peace upon reaſonable Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and give my Lord Chancellor Order to inſiſt and enlarge upon thoſe Heads, and to declare the Affronts which the Dutch put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Royal Family before my Reſtoration; which as it will incenſe the Cavaliers in the Houſe, it will ſilence thoſe who are fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally inclin'd. And the better to colour my Demands of Money, I muſt take care to have the ill Condition that my Magazines for Arms and Naval Stores were in, repreſented to the full, and the Pains and Charges which I have been at magnified to the life.</p>
               <p>The Parliament I find have anſwered my Expectations, and not only ordered me ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtore of Money to carry on the War, but have given a Gratuity to my Brother the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98018:65"/> Duke, notwithſtanding of its having been repreſented by ſome, that his Cowardice, under pretence of want of Repoſe, gave the Dutch an Opportunity to eſcape better than they would have done otherwiſe. And that nothing may be left unattempted which may tend to the Ruine of the Proteſtant Intereſt, he and I have not only delivered up Monſieur <hi>Rohan,</hi> who came to acquaint me with the French King's Deſigns to ruine his Proteſtant Subjects, and to propoſe Meaſures which might have prevented it, and advanc'd my own Glory, as he imagin'd, but by my Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation I have alſo got the ſtricteſt of my own Proteſtant Subjects declar'd uncapable of Truſt, except they comply with that which is contrary to their Conſciences, and their Preachers to be baniſh'd five Miles from Corporations, which is a thing of mighty Conſequence to the carrying on of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; for by this Means I ſhall not now be peſtered with Returns of Preciſians and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans for Members of Parliament, nor can they have any ſhare in the managing of the Government: And as for the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are ſo much taken up with the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Rituals of their Church, that they are not very ſollicitous what Innovations be made in her Doctrine: And I have always found that their Harmony with the Church
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98018:66"/> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the outward part, hath engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in them a better Opinion of the Papiſts than Presbyterians. And thus at once I ſtrike at the Proteſtant Intereſt at home and abroad. It's true that the delivering up of that French Gentleman, and our placing the French Ambaſſador behind the Curtain, to hear his Complaints and Propoſals for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, may ſeem inglorious, and a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Crowned Head: But as it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm my Friends the Papiſts, in their good Opinion of me, it muſt needs be an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the French King, though I am but little obliged to his Care of my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſuffered the Criminal to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd as to his Converſe with me, while they were breaking him upon the Wheel; but I perceive he thinks it his Intereſt to keep me low in the good Opinion of my Subjects, leſt I ſhould put a ſtop to the Career of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which is his Predominant, as Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is mine: but he is miſtaken in his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, I am as zealous for promoting of the Catholick Religion as he can be, nor do I care how or by what Methods it is effected, ſo it be but accompliſhed. But I ſhall not trouble my ſelf neither to enlarge my own, nor ſtop the Courſe of his Conqueſts; for I am as much concern'd to gratify my predominant Paſſion, which requires Eaſe, as he is to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify

               <p>THE Dutch having recall'd their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, imports that they have no Hopes of obtaining a Peace; however, to dazle the Eyes of the World a little further, I'll ſend a Letter by him, with an Offer of Propoſals to the States, wherein I will charge them as the Beginners of the War, and teſtify my own Inclination to bring it to an end; which, though it is plain will never obtain Belief, yet will ſerve for a Pretence, that the Continuance of the War is not my choice, and conſequently free me a little from the Odium of the Havock which the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> with his Popiſh Forces, makes in a Proteſtant Country, and furniſh Arguments to my Friends of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt thoſe who ſuggeſt that my Deſign at bottom is to promote a Popiſh Intereſt.</p>

               <p>The mutual Declarations of War by my ſelf and the French King againſt each other, will very much contribute to a Concealment of our Deſigns, and give us an opportunity of deſtroying the Dutch more advantagiouſly; for I am very well aſſured that the French Troops, which march to the Aſſiſtance of the Hollanders, will annoy them as much as thoſe of their Enemies, and make them quickly repent the calling in of ſuch Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: but however there is this which will be gain'd by it, that it cannot well be thought that my Deſign is againſt the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when a Monarch, who is a profeſſed Papiſt, and the eldeſt Son of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> does ſeemingly oppoſe me, though by the Meſſage which he lately ſent to my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath ſufficiently inform'd me as to his ſecret Intenſions; ſo that betwixt us I doubt not but we ſhall ruine that Knot of Hereticks: And as I have brought their Friends here in <hi>England</hi> under the Laſh of the Law, I will take care to undo their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where by the Concurrence of their new Biſhops, and the Zeal of my Privy Council, I can do what I pleaſe, ſeeing all the Presbyterians are excluded the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: And thus while I ſet one Party of Proteſtants againſt another at home, and daſh the Proteſtants of <hi>England</hi> againſt thoſe of

               <p>THE Sword, Peſtilence and Fire, are three of the heavieſt Plagues that can befal a People; and of late I and mine have had our Shares of them. This dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration would be as pleaſant to me as that of <hi>Rome</hi> was to <hi>Nero,</hi> when he took his Harp in hand and triumph'd over its Flames, if it were not that I am liable to the Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of favouring it, becauſe my Brother and my Guards are ſo fooliſh and imprudent as to reſcue thoſe who are taken in the Fact; and that ſome Catholicks, who are not fit to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98018:68"/> be intruſted with Secrets, have talk'd too openly of the Deſign a great while before it was put in Execution. However, this is a good Expedient to clear both the City and the Air about it, from all manner of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Infection: for that I could not ſet any Bounds unto, but this I can limit; That was the Hand of God, This the Hand of Man; That did promiſcuouſly cut off my Friends and Foes, but This I can order ſo as to make it fall upon the latter: and after all, if I cannot, as <hi>Nero</hi> did with the Chriſtians, faſten the Plot of firing the City upon the Diſſenters, which the Jeſuits have ſtrenuouſly endeavoured, by tricking ſome ſilly Fifth-Monarchy-men into a Plot; yet if I give it only a little finer turn, and alledg, that it's the Vengeance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon this City, for their being ſo inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the late Ruine both of Church and State, and not preventing my Father's Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Pretext will be plauſible and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the Church; for their great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, ſuch as <hi>Heylin</hi> and others, have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times declared their Diſlike of the Bulk and Populouſneſs of the City, and hate it becauſe inclinable to the Puritanical Side: ſo that theſe things being prudently inſiſted upon, and the Clergy's Diſlike of the City encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, its Deſolation and Ruines will be the leſs regarded, and the Odium wear off from
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98018:69"/> the Papiſts by degrees, though at the ſame time they have wiſely deſtroyed that which was look'd upon as the great Bulwark of the Proteſtant Religion. And I have alſo reaſon to be very well ſatisfied that hereby they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted the great Treaſure of Rebellion. But the main Danger is, leſt the Committee of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, appointed to dive into the Cauſes of the Fire, ſhould trace it as far as St. <hi>James</hi>'s and <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and then it will lie upon me and my Brother: but if this ſhould be the caſe, I know of a Remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> to call it a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of the Diſſenters, to bring a Calumny upon the Royal Family, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are their Adherents; then to be ſure, though the Matter be as clear as Sunſhine, the Biſhops and their Clergy, who know they muſt ſtand and fall with me, will maintain my Credit for their own Intereſt, leſt they ſhould be utterly overthrown, as in my Father's time. And the better to cover my Deſign, I muſt renew all my former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and adviſe the Citizens, in the firſt place, to rebuild their Churches, where they may worſhip God, and mourn for their Sins, which have brought on ſuch deſolating Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and this, together with contributing ſomething towards the Re-edification of the City, and bewailing their Loſſes on all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98018:69"/> Occaſions, will conciliate their Reſpect, and beget a good Opinion of me, which will be ſufficient to obviate all the Miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the greateſt of my Enemies can make of me: and thus ſhall the Proteſtant Intereſt languiſh, as by a Conſumption in the Vitals, while I ſmite it ſecretly under the fifth Rib. I know that the cenſorious Phanaticks will ſay that this Fire was carried on by the ſame Hand that manages the War againſt the Dutch; and that the City is juſtly puniſh'd thereby for not oppoſing, but rather concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with me; and that I have repaid them as I have done all my other Friends, the Dutch, the Spaniards, and the Engliſh and Scots Presbyterians: ſo that for their aſſiſting me with their Treaſure to carry on the War againſt the Dutch, I and my Party have conſumed their Subſtance. But having taken care to have that Faction look'd upon as my Enemies, whatever they ſay againſt me will be reckoned Spite; and therefore though it be true, it won't be much credited. And for any Improvement which the Dutch may make of it, as that I am puniſh'd by Fire in my own Capital City, for endeavouring to bring Fire and Sword upon them; I can eaſily hear them, and laugh at their Folly, for aſcribing that to Providence which is my own Action, and looking upon that as my Puniſhment
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98018:70"/> which I eſteem my Advantage; and ſo far from being their Gain, that it is their irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Loſs, for the Puritanical Citizens were their true Friends. It's indeed no ſmall Cauſe of Triumph to the Roman Catholicks, that inſtead of the Fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks call <hi>Rome,</hi> which they expected in 1666. the greateſt City of the Reformation ſhould lie in Aſhes, with 89 of their Churches which were polluted with Hereſy; 13200 of their Houſes; 150000 <hi>l</hi>'s Worth of their Books; and in the whole to the Value of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt nine and ten Millions of their Goods: ſo that for once the Catholicks have put the Writ, <hi>de Haeretico comburendo,</hi> very effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in execution upon their Houſes, the Fire or Plague of God having not long before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd above a Million of their Perſons. And if there be any ſuch thing as a Deity, the Catholicks might very well ſay now, as in their Letter to my Lord <hi>Mounteagle,</hi> which diſcovered the Powder-plot in my Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's time, that God and Man had agreed to puniſh this Heretical Generation.</p>

               <p>THough the Catholicks have not been able to blow up the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with all the Lords and Commons, yet they have conſum'd the City, which was both the Fountain of the Hereticks Treaſure and Strength. And to diſable the Party fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have conveen'd the Parliament, who, I doubt not, will dive to the bottom of their Purſes, and ſupply me with Money to ruine their Brethren the Heretical Dutch.</p>
               <p>Though the Parliament hath been liberal enough in parting with their Money, yet I find they are alarm'd at the Increaſe and Growth of Popery; and accordingly have importun'd me with an Addreſs. It is not time for me yet to pull off my Vizard, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98018:71"/> therefore I muſt grant a Proclamation to pleaſe them; but the Prieſts and Jeſuits ſhall ſtill have Protection, as Attendants belonging to my Conſort the Queen.</p>
               <p>Their Brethren the Diſſenters ſhall pay for this Animoſity of theirs againſt the Papiſts; and I will take care that the Laws ſhall be put in execution againſt them. Let them remind me of my Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> promiſing Eaſe to tender Conſciences, as much as they pleaſe, I am at liberty to change my Meaſures according to my Intereſt. The Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland</hi> have been condignly puniſh'd by Fines, Free-quarter, and Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Execution, which hath happily procur'd an Inſurrection according to my Deſire. So that now the greateſt of my Rigour will be juſtified; and when they pretend to be Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres for Religion, I can accuſe them of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. This furniſhes me with a juſtifiable Pretence to cut off ſome of their Ringleaders at preſent, and endeavour the Extirpation of the reſt by degrees. And this I am ſure to have approved by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe the Presbyterians obliged themſelves to the Extirpation of Prelacy by their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. This will alſo ſerve to heighten the Reſentments of the Epiſcopal Party againſt the Dutch, when I repreſent how the Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks act in concert with them, and do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98018:71"/> favour their Deſigns, by beginning an inteſtine War when I am engaged with them abroad. Whence they will eaſily be perſwaded of the neceſſity of complying with my Meaſures againſt both, eſpecially when I inſinuate the Danger that there is to the Church and the Crown, if the Diſſenters ſhould not be rendred uncapable of diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either. When I once inſpire them with theſe Sentiments, they will the better concur with my Declaration againſt <hi>Denmark,</hi> for ſiding with the Rebellious and Heretical Dutch; and by this Means my Brother of <hi>France</hi> and I ſhall reach a fatal Blow indeed to the Northern Hereſy, by the Concurrence of the Hereticks themſelves: for as my Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Subjects will certainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me on the Conſiderations above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo the French Hugonots concur with their Monarch to deſtroy thoſe of their own Religion, they being alſo ſcrued up to a high pitch of Loyalty, by the Cunning of the Court, and the Management of their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. And thus when we have deprived our Heretical Subjects of all Support from abroad, it will be the eaſier for us to deſtroy them at home.</p>
               <p>How unhappily are all my fine Projects blaſted, and my Deſigns againſt the Dutch not only miſcarried, but they have put theirs
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98018:72"/> in execution againſt me, burnt my Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Navy in my own Haroours, and ride without Controul upon my Coaſts. This is indeed an intolerable Diſgrace, but I muſt ſtudy how to repair it. The Want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney were a plauſible Excuſe, but conſidering the Tax which I lately had, it will not be practicable, and therefore I muſt indeavour to excuſe it, by charging it on the Treachery of the Dutch during the time of a Treaty; which, though it is not likely to obtain Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief amongſt knowing Men, yet it will do much to put a ſtop to the Murmurs of the Vulgar: and in the mean time I muſt ſtudy how to work a Revenge, and not ſuffer them long to triumph in their Succeſs. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the French King takes advantage of my Circumſtances, and hath deluded me on purpoſe to carry on his own Deſigns, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out that the Dutch would have no Fleet at Sea this Summer. Let him hug and bleſs himſelf for his good Succeſs, I may find an Opportunity to make him repent it: May he flatter himſelf as a great Politician, and fram'd by Nature for the Empire of the World, I can ſooner accompliſh my Deſigns than he can do his, and ſatisfy my Deſires with thoſe things which I look upon as my <hi>Summum Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> Whereas he can never ſatisfy his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and as he makes me to ſubſerve his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98018:72"/> Deſigns, his Money ſhall alſo ſubſerve mine; and while he pleaſes himſelf with the Thoughts of conquering <hi>Europe,</hi> I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge my ſelf in ſuch Conqueſts as are more agreeable to my Nature, though at the ſame time I am reſolved to give a check to his grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Greatneſs, by clapping up a Peace with the Dutch and Danes: and thus I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge my ſelf on him for dealing ſo diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably with me, as to ſuffer it to be printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> that my Deſign againſt <hi>Holland</hi> was for advancing Popery</p>

I know that their Commiſſioners will ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Proof againſt Gold; ſo that I can eaſily take them off if they become too inquiſitive. This yielding a little will give me an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to renew my Blow with the greater Force. And from their Complaints of the Nation's not being ſecur'd againſt Foreign Inſults, I ſhall take the Opportunity to raiſe an Army in the Interval of Parliament, but model them ſo as to render them fit for my Deſign, if poſſible, both of raiſing Money without Parliaments, and advancing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> If I cannot have all the Officers avowed Papiſts, I ſhall at leaſt order it ſo that they be not Haters of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for none ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted without Father <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To encamp them near the City will be moſt commodious, that ſo they may overawe both it and the Parliament.</p>
               <p>But, alas! I find that my Deſign is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; and the Commons being met, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to defeat it. My Aim was glorious indeed, but my Succeſs unanſwerable; ſo that Nature ſeems to have deſign'd me for the Conqueſt of Women, but not of Men. A Prince who has not the Command of his Subjects Purſes, can never ſay that he has the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98018:74"/> Command of their Perſons; for I muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Parliament, becauſe I want Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or otherwiſe I am ſure they'l give me none. The Army that I rais'd muſt again be disbanded; elſe they'l never be ſatisfied, nor have their Jealouſies removed; ſo that I find I muſt take another Method. If the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks grumble at the Slowneſs of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, they may remember that the Work in hand is Church-work. I am reſolv'd never to ſacrifice my own Quiet to any Party or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion; but now that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obtain'd my Throne, will labour to keep it, having already experienc'd the Miſery of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduc'd to Travel. They may be alſo convinc'd from my Failure in this Attempt, that I want not Will but Power to ſerve them; and that to hurry on the Deſign by Force is the way to ruine both them and me. It's true, that's a very great Mortification to a Soveraign, to receive a Check from thoſe who ought to obey him; but whatever it hath had upon others, it ſhall have no great Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon me, who am reſolv'd to purſue Eaſe and Pleaſure as my chief Good.</p>
               <p>But the Parliament having taken the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, I muſt ſweeten them by ſoft Speeches; which with the Aſſiſtance of my Friends in the Houſe, will take off their Edg. I will tell them that they ſhall follow their own
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98018:74"/> Methods in bringing thoſe who have received the Publick Money to an account; and that their Grievances ſhall be redreſſed. I know that the disbanding of the Forces on their Deſire, the diſplacing of my Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide,</hi> and diſmiſſing of Papiſts from my Guards, will be acceptable to them. And to pleaſe them yet further, I will publiſh a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Papiſts; and that none ſhall fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Popiſh Chappels of <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi>'s, or Foreign Ambaſſadors, but thoſe who belong to my Mother, the Queen Conſort, and the Ambaſſador's own Families, though at the ſame time I ſhall take care that they ſuffer no Damage for contraveening it. And to pluck up their Jealouſies by the very Roots, that I may give them the more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Blow, I will make a defenſive Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Dutch and Swedes, which will remove all their Fears, as to the head of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And another for an effectual Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which will look with a favourable Aſpect towards their Civil Rights: but in the mean time I ſhall connive at the Progreſs of the French Arms in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> the better to make way for our Deſigns upon <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament being thus ſweetned, I will move for Money to rig out another Fleet, which as ſoon as I obtain, they ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98018:75"/> and prorogued, ſo as they may not trouble me with their Importunities to aſſiſt the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> for I know they will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing of the French King's Neighbourhood, though the ſame will be convenient for me to accompliſh my Deſigns: for in that caſe they will be prevail'd upon by their Fear to allow me a ſtanding Army, that I may always be provided againſt ſuch a potent Enemy; and then in a little time I ſhall rule by the Sword, and command their Money to ſpend upon my Pleaſures.</p>

               <p>IF I cannot ruine the Intereſt of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in General, yet I can keep thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who are obnoxious to the Laws which were happily procured during the Height of the Church of <hi>England's</hi> Zeal and Loyalty. And ſeeing all my other Meaſures fail me, I am reſolv'd to drive the Nail that will go.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98018:75"/> That Phanatical Crew are my greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therefore I have reaſon to deal with them as ſuch: Their Rigidity of Principles, and Auſterity of Practice, render them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all Men who love their Pleaſures; and they are no leſs hateful to me, becauſe of their Politicks, as having an inveterate Prejudice againſt the Prerogative, and being great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of the Privileges of Parliament; ſo that from thoſe of their Kidney I meet with the greateſt Obſtructions, for which I have ſworn and will take a Revenge: It being more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over my Intereſt to nouriſh mutual Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties amongſt my Proteſtant Subjects, and make the two Factions irreconcileable, that ſo I may keep them from uniting againſt me in defence of their Common Religion and Liberties. By this Method I have humbled the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and I doubt not but it will have the ſame effect in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's neceſſary however for the concealing of my Deſign, to invite the Dutch and Swedes to a League, who both of them being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant States, it will poſſeſs the common People, that I have ſtill a Zeal for that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but in reality I ſhall hereby enſnare the Dutch, and render them more liable to the Fury of <hi>France.</hi> My being divided from them by the Sea will furniſh me with Excuſes for delaying to give them Aſſiſtance; or if I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98018:76"/> ſend them any Forces, I can prevent their being ſerviceable; make uſe of them, as I find Opportunity, to ſeize ſome of their Towns, or find occaſion of Quarrel, and join the French. However, this Triple League will pleaſe my Parliament: and to impoſe further upon them, I will propound a nearer Alliance with the Dutch, and bring the French and the Spaniards to a Treaty of Peace, which my Subjects will look upon as the ſecuring of themſelves; but at the ſame time I will take care to maintain the French Intereſt, and ſecure them ſome conſiderable Poſts upon the Frontiers, that ſo the Door may be open for a new Invaſion, whenever he ſees his time. However, I muſt not be wanting to have my Conduct in this Point applauded to the height; as alſo my Care for the Honour, Safety and Commerce of my Subjects in this Affair magnified, the better to obtain a Subſidy from the Parliament. The Spaniards I know are diſſatisfied at this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe it obliges them to a Surrender of a great part of their Country; and the French are not well pleaſed to be ſtopp'd in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer; but I muſt prefer my own Intereſt to both: It's for my Reputation to be ſucceſsful in ſo weighty an Affair; and it will make me the more valued at home, when they ſee that I have ſo much Influence abroad.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLIV.</hi> On the Interview betwixt his Majeſty and his Siſter, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> at <hi>Dover;</hi> and her Advice to him to break the Triple League, and concur with the French King to deſtroy the Dutch and the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and render himſelf abſolute in <hi>England.</hi> Her leaving one of her Maids of Honour, created afterwards Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> behind her; and her own Death ſpeedily after her Return into <hi>France.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Meſſenger is enough to procure Acceptance to the Meſſage; for who can deny the Requeſt of ſuch a beautiful Princeſs, though ſhe were not my Siſter? The Meſſage of it ſelf is very acceptable, though infinitely full of hazardous Intrigue. It will reflect upon my Honour to break that League of which I was in a manner the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and invited all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> to join in it. It's true, I am pretty well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to breaking of Compacts; ſo that this will not be my firſt Eſſay: and though others may not only hate but contemn me for it, yet this Satisfaction I ſhall certainly reap from it, that thereby I outwit ſo many Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98018:77"/> Princes, whereas hitherto I have only deceived my own Subjects. Though this League be made with more honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet it was far from being ſo ſolemn as the Scots League and Covenant: ſo that as to what concerns Conſcience, I may as well do the leſs as the greater; and in this I have an Advantage which I wanted in that, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>XIVth</hi> for a Partner in the Crime, if it be one: and it's pretty manifeſt to all that know us, that we never intended to be Slaves to our Word.</p>
               <p>To deſtroy the Dutch and the Proteſtant Religion, and render my ſelf abſolute in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are all Glorious Deſigns, but not ſo eaſy to be practis'd as propos'd. For my Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the firſt I can form plauſible Pretexts enough; and if that were once accompliſh'd, the other will be the more eaſily effected. Great Deſigns ought to be deeply weighed, and therefore I muſt give a cautious Anſwer, but not engage in a poſitive Promiſe; yet ſomething I muſt ſay to pleaſe the Meſſenger, in order to obtain my Deſires of her, which I muſt confeſs Nature ſeems to abhor; but my heightned Paſſion will neither admit any Limits nor Denial. How happy are they in thoſe Parts of the World where they know no ſuch Reſtraints as we who are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do labour under? there their Loves are
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98018:77"/> promiſcuous, without Offence, and they have no Reſtraint on the Appetites of Nature, but ſatisfy all its Deſires to the full: Then why ſhould I be ſcrupulous, or filled with Horror, upon ſuch a Motion of the Fleſh as this? It's only the Cuſtom and Tenets which we imbibe, that make ſuch Impreſſions as theſe upon us. If the Nations where promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Amours are allowed without reſtraint, thought it contrary to the Laws of Nature, or had any Qualms of Conſcience for the Practice, they would never have allowed it; and therefore my Scruples muſt altogether be owing to my Education. The Mahumetans have no Checks of Conſcience for their Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy, becauſe their Cuſtoms and Principles allow it. And it was the like with thoſe who were call'd the Saints of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nay, <hi>Lot</hi> enjoy'd his own Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and <hi>Abraham</hi> had his Father's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Wife. The firſt, it's true, was not the Effect of Choice, but I am certain the latter was; and if all be true that I have heard, as in truth from my own Temper I have no reaſon to doubt of it, there's Cauſe enough to queſtion whether ſhe be not only the Daughter of my Mother, and not of my Father, and in that caſe I am but even with <hi>Abraham:</hi> And as for my violating both my own and the Duke of <hi>Orleance's</hi> Contracts
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98018:78"/> of Marriage, I may be allowed to come ſo far ſhort of the Father of the Faithful. Let Puritans and Preciſians do what they pleaſe, for my own part I will worſhip no Deity, except <hi>Priapus</hi> be one; nor do I deſire any other Heaven than <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Paradiſe. If this ſhould take air, my Phanatical Subjects would improve it againſt me, and ſay, that ſuch unhallowed Cauſes muſt needs have curſed Effects; and that Popery and Slavery can never be uſher'd in by any other Means than ſuch as violate both the Laws of Nature and Religion, and open the Sluce to the Height of Impiety. They would quickly tell me that a Cuſtom of Sinning hardens the Conſcience; and that ſuch promiſcous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours had no little Influence on the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgments which have from time to time laid ſo many of the Heathen Nations deſolate, and particularly brought the Sword of the cruel Spaniard upon the Americans: That the Failings of the Old-Teſtament-Saints are not to be Patterns for thoſe who live under the New: That <hi>Abraham's</hi> Wife was not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Daughter, but Grand-Daughter by Law: And that the New Teſtament hath excluded all Whoremongers and Adulterers from the Kingdom of Heaven; with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more of ſuch Cant, which influences me to deny that Faction any peaceable Reſidence
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98018:78"/> in my Kingdom upon Earth, as being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, the Leaven of all humane Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an ungrateful Check upon Jollity and Mirth, attributing that to the Effects of Religion and Divine Zeal, which is merely occaſioned by Phlegm and Melancholy.</p>
               <p>The bad Influence which ſo near a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as the flouriſhing Republick of <hi>Holland</hi> may have to animate my Subjects to re-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſuch a Form of Government, will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my Policy in ſeeking its Deſtruction. And the Roman Maxim of <hi>Carthago eſt delenda,</hi> and deſtroying of thoſe who ſtudy to rival us in our Trade and Naval Strength, will be taking with the Engliſh Nation: and my Concern in deſtroying their Religion will be covered, by having the French King for my Ally, who is a Roman Catholick by Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that that Affair will be wholly aſcrib'd to him. As to the Propoſal of ruining the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>England,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring my ſelf abſolute, the Reaſons of the Attempt are much eaſier than the Means; ſome of which are alſo not ill concerted, as flattering the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them in a ſevere Perſecution of the Diſſenters, who are indeed the firmeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. Then as for the rendring of my ſelf abſolute, the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath already pav'd my way toward it,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98018:79"/> amongſt thoſe of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And on the other hand I can trick the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into a Concurrence with it, by diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the Penal Laws, under which they ſmart ſo ſeverely; ſo that they will contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to heighten this part of my Prerogative for their own eaſe: and if once I can ſecure my ſelf in the quiet poſſeſſion of this Practice of diſpenſing with Laws, the reſt of my Work will be the more eaſy, eſpecially if once the Dutch were ruined, and their Countries and beſt Towns ſhared betwixt the French and me; for in that caſe my Heretical Subjects can neither have Aſſiſtance from thence, nor Recourſe thither. And as for <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Epiſcopal Party there having no other Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt but mine; and being wholly deſtitute of the Peoples Favour, I am in no danger of any Diſturbance from that Kingdom, now that I have brought the Presbyterians in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo low: And that which will be no little ſerviceable to my Affairs, is, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scotland</hi> have made an Act to raiſe me 22000 Horſe and Foot to ſerve in any part of my Dominions, ſuch cordial Friends are their Epiſcopal Party to the Intereſt of the Crown.</p>
               <p>My Siſter has not only granted me her laſt Favours, but left me a very agreeable Preſent to nouriſh my Flames. My Brother of <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:98018:79"/> has hit the Mark, and if he continues both to fill my Purſe, and ſatisfy my Love, as my Occaſions require, he ſhall find me a very uſeful Friend.</p>
               <p>But, alas! my Pleaſures are always mix'd with an Alloy of Mortification: My Siſter's Kindneſs to me hath been her Death. It might have been thought that the Height of our Rank ſhould have ſet us above the reach of Spies; and that the Nearneſs of our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould have taken away all Cauſe of Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that the Danger of divulging the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſhould have lock'd it up in eternal Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; or if it had been otherwiſe, that it ſhould not ſo readily have obtain'd Belief: but I am now convinc'd of the contrary by the diſmal Effects; and yet I muſt be content, and lay aſide all Thoughts of Revenge, leſt the thing ſhould be laid open to the View of the World. I muſt henceforth take care to obſerve the Maxim of living <hi>cautè,</hi> ſeeing I cannot live <hi>caſtè:</hi> and though my open Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice has declared that I am not to be bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Cuſtoms and Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as to my Love-Intrigues; yet I muſt be cautious how I intrench on the Laws of Nature, becauſe of the general Abhorrence thereof which is impreſs'd upon all Men. I muſt alſo take care that I be not thought to debaſe my ſelf by the Meanneſs of my Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98018:80"/> and therefore will at leaſt dignify my new French Paramour with the Title of a Dutcheſs.</p>
               <p>It's a great while ſince I abſolv'd my ſelf from the Trouble of making any Prayer to that Bugbear which Princes and Clergymen would impoſe upon the World, under the Notion of a Deity, merely to render the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Slaves to themſelves: And the principal Reaſon for eaſing my ſelf of this Trouble was, becauſe I perceived that all things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened alike to thoſe who are called Good, and thoſe who are called Bad. But if there are any Beings ſuperiour to Men, I think that the Notion of the ancient Heathens, who were for a Plurality of Gods, has very much Reaſon in it; and the Roman Catholick Church ſeems to own the ſame thing, though under a different Name, when they have ſo many Saints and Angels to whom they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves, according to the Diverſity of their Occaſions, which does neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that they believe a Plurality of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Omniſcient Beings. Then ſeeing the Caſe is thus, it cannot be amiſs for me, that, in imitation of their Example, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my ſelf to Patrons ſutable to my preſent Neceſſities: And it being <hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> whoſe Aſſiſtance I do moſt ſtand in need of, it's reaſonable that I ſhould make Application
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98018:80"/> to them both conjunctly, but chiefly to the firſt. Nor can I ſee why it ſhould be culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in me to make Requeſts to them in my Proſperity, ſeeing my Father is ſaid to have made uſe of a Prayer taken from an amorous Romance, in the Height of his Adverſity, though it had been conſecrated before-hand to an Heathen Deity. And whereas he whom Chriſtians look upon as the Omnipotent, hath commanded us in his Word to <hi>increaſe</hi> and <hi>multiply,</hi> without any manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, it ought not to be offenſive to them if I obey him in this Particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thou, O</hi> Priapus! <hi>ſeeing the Female De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi> Venus <hi>hath caſt a favourable Aſpect towards me, as Monarch of the Britains, who are the lineal Deſcendants of her beloved Trojans, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the fair Sex have hitherto received my Addreſſes very kindly, as becomes thoſe who would be obſequious to that beautiful Goddeſs; be not thou leſs propitious to me than ſhe, but aſſiſt me to the utmoſt of thy Power, that I may be capable of a grateful Retribution to the fair Nymphs who bleſs me with their Favours. I have a ſtubborn and rebellious People, who are more addicted to War than Love; but do thou inſpire them with amorous Inclinations, and wound them with the Darts of</hi> Cupid, <hi>that they may grow out of Conceit with thoſe of</hi> Mars.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98018:81"/> 
                  <hi>They are fond of Parliaments, becauſe created by themſelves; but if thou wilt be pleaſed to vouchſafe me thy Favour, I may govern them in time by a Parliament begotten by my ſelf. My Sons ſhall quickly over-ballance the Lords, and their Intereſts and mine will have no little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Commons, amongſt whom I can alſo beſtow ſome of my Daughters. Then ſhall I erect Altars to the God of Love, and make his Conqueſts as large as my Dominions. Let thoſe who call themſelves Chriſtians admire their own Chaſtity, and boaſt of their Temperance as loud as they can, I don't find but their Patron was very favourable to the Adultreſs; and</hi> Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, <hi>one of the firſt of their Sect, maintain'd a Community of Wives. Do thou aſſiſt me, and I doubt not but to make thy Religion triumph over theirs; for I am ſure that the Number of thoſe who are led by the Fleſh, is greater than the Number of them that are led by the Spirit. Nor is it from me alone that thou art to expect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Thanks, but from</hi> Venus <hi>her ſelf, and her beautiful Train, and particularly thoſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies who have now devoted themſelves to my Service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To</hi> Hymen <hi>I have twice perform'd ſolemn Adoration, but to thee I vow perpetual Worſhip, and will extend my Amours as far as my Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. Do not thou, O Goddeſs of Beauty! withdraw thy Kindneſs; but as thou haſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98018:81"/> my Conqueſts hitherto, be pleaſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large them, that I may become Father of my Country in Deed as well as in Name. I have ſometimes been apt to blame the Phanaticks for their long Prayers, but if they be as intent on the obtaining of their Deſires, as I am for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of mine, I find there's no great Reaſon for it. I am ſure that this is the longeſt Prayer that ever I made in my Life; and accordingly as I find your Anſwers I ſhall proportion my Praiſes, and repay my Thank-offerings on the Altars of</hi> Bacchus; <hi>you being the only Trinity whom I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, and the</hi> Eleuſina Sacra, <hi>my beloved Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>

               <p>THis is a very bold and daring Attempt, and ſuch as may excite Wonder ſooner than Belief. If there be many ſuch daring Spirits among the Phanaticks, it is not Policy
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98018:82"/> to provoke them too much, leſt ſome attempt my Life, as others have done the Crown. However, ſeeing the Deſign hath miſcarried, it's fit that I ſhould improve it, which may be done ſeveral ways: It will ſerve as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to heighten my Reſentments againſt the Diſſenters, and juſtify my dealing ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them. It will alſo ſerve for a Subject of Clamour againſt them to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and animate them to proſecute the Puritans to the utmoſt; and at the ſame time countenance my Pretences of a neceſſity to diſpenſe with the Laws againſt them, while I am engaged with a foreign Enemy, leſt they ſhould be provok'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſomething more dangerous, though nothing can be more diſgraceful than this would have been, had it ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>The better to cover the Treaty at <hi>Dover,</hi> and to prevent the Suſpicion of my Siſter's having engag'd me to do any thing in favour of the Catholicks, I muſt emit a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt them as uſual; and though I never intend to put it in execution, the Neglect will be eaſily faſtned upon the inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. I cannot but wonder at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Zeal of the Parliament againſt the Growth of Popery, when at the ſame time they are ſo zealous for a Popiſh Form of Church-Government and Ceremonies, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98018:82"/> concur to make ſuch ſevere Laws againſt their Brethren the Diſſenters. This muſt proceed from ſome Political but not Religious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. They are without doubt unwilling to part with their Church-Lands, to have the old Tax of <hi>Peter</hi>-Pence renewed, and be obliged to ſubmit their Necks to the Pope's Uſurpation. Theſe, I don't queſtion, are the Grievances of the Laity; and the Loſs of their Benefices and Wives have no leſs Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Clergy. Nor indeed is this particular Averſion to Popery to be very much wondred at in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing Popery in all its Pretenſions is not admitted by the Church of <hi>France,</hi> which has no good liking to the Pope's Supremacy, nor did ever admit the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the War with the Dutch, I muſt urge all the Arguments to have it effectuated; which my own Invention, and thoſe of the Cabal, are able to furniſh. Their Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Trade being that which will be moſt plauſible with the Populace, the ſeveral Companies muſt be influenc'd to make Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints on that Head againſt them; or if they won't, yet I can aſſert it boldly in my Declaration. It's true that the Phanatical Part of my Subjects perceive my Deſign, and mutter it where they dare do it with Safety; but a Royal Declaration will be ſufficient to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98018:83"/> weigh down the Clamours of ſuch: And though they complain of the Injuries done to my Subjects in the Foreign Plantations by the French, yet all theſe muſt be buried in Oblivion; ſo that I ſhall order ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to be received, but the Grievances ſhall never be redreſſed. I muſt alſo repreſent the Diſhonour done to the Nation, by the Dutch's refuſing to ſtrike to the Engliſh Flag; and the Affronts put upon my ſelf by ſcandalous Medals and Pictures, which my Penſioners and Friends in the Houſe of Commons will take care to aggravate to the Height. It will be a meritorious piece of Service at this time to find occaſion of Quarrel with the Dutch, now when they are out in purſuance of the Triple League, to prevent the Progreſs of the French in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> It is not to be ſuppoſed that they will be guilty of ſuch a manifeſt Breach, as to refuſe to ſtrike to my Fleet, or any of my Men of War in my own Seas, and therefore I will order a ſmall Yatch to ſail through their Navy on their own Coaſt; and upon their not ſtriking, as in ſuch a caſe they will ſcarcely think themſelves oblig'd to do, I ſhall have Ground enough to found a Quarrel.</p>
               <p>My next Care muſt be to prevent the Dutch's coming to a Treaty, or offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and to declare War when they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98018:83"/> come near a Concluſion, that ſo the French may have Opportunity of over-running their Country; and they and I ſhall divide the Spoil. But this being a Deſign of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, I muſt take care to keep it ſecret; and therefore it's fit that I ſhould put out of the Council all thoſe that are diſaffected to the Intrigue, on the pretence of its being contrary to the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>A War with the Dutch being reſolved on, my next Care muſt be to provide Money, which are its Sinews: The purſuit of my Pleaſures, which are the chiefeſt Good that my Soul deſires, have drain'd my Treaſury, ſo that I muſt think of ſome Method to fill it again. My Subjects are averſe to this War againſt their Fellow-Proteſtants, and will not eaſily be brought to contribute for carrying it on; but having decoyed abundance of the wealthieſt of them to bring their Money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Exchequer, upon hopes of great Gain, I am reſolv'd to ſhut it up, and apply the Money found there to the Uſe of the War. This will be an effectual Means to drain the Purſes of my Heretical Subjects; and if they murmur, I ſhall make uſe of their own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to chaſtiſe them: but I am in no hazard of a Rebellion upon this account, for although the Loſs will affect the whole Nation, yet
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98018:84"/> immediately it reaches only to few: None put in Money into the Exchequer but thoſe who have enough left behind; and for ſuch, they'l be loth to hazard the Loſs of the reſt by any Tumult or Sedition, eſpecially when Paſſive Obedience is preach'd to them daily from the Pulpits, that their Lives and Fortunes ought all to be at the Service of their Prince, who has Power to make uſe of them as he thinks fit, according to the ſeveral Exigencies of State. This being one certain Method of procuring Money to carry on the War at the Charge of my Heretical Subjects, I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in view, to make the Dutch contribute toward it themſelves, and that is by ſeizing their <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet before War be declared. This, it's true, will look ill, but the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Maxim, that Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, abſolves me from all Guilt: and if I be ſucceſsful in the War, as I have very great Reaſon to hope, then I can juſtify the Action by the Event, as I did formerly when I fell upon their Fleet before <hi>Cadiz;</hi> and yet I have weather'd out all the Storms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach which were impending over me upon that Account.</p>
               <p>To blind my Subjects ſtill further, I muſt pretend that nothing but unavoidable Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could have prevail'd with me to have ſhut up the Exchequer; but that the Welfare and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98018:84"/> Advantage of particular Perſons muſt always give way to that of the Publick; that it's better to ſeize the Money of a few, to make uſe of it in Defence of the whole, than ſuffer Foreigners to invade us, and hazard our All; that ſeeing all my Neighbours are preparing for War, it's not fit that I ſhould lay my ſelf open to Surprize; and my Treaſure being ſpent, and my Revenues anticipated, it's but reaſonable that I ſhould take the firſt Money that comes to hand, for defence of the Publick. Then as to my attacking the Dutch, I muſt juſtify it by charging them with Ingratitude to this Nation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the many Favours conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by my ſelf and Predeceſſors: and I am ſure of having the Clergy on my ſide, becauſe of the Hatred which they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dutch, both upon the account of their Government in Church and State; and they, together with the Court-Party, will raiſe a Clamour ſufficient to drown the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of the Phanaticks, whom I have alſo endeavoured to take off by diſpenſing with the Laws which are in being againſt them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLVI.</hi> On the Dutch's ſurprizing our Fleet in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold-bay,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being Admiral. His Majeſty's Declaration to the Dutch. The Progreſs of the French in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. His Majeſty's and the French King's Propoſals to the Dutch, and their rejecting them, and making the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Stadtholder.</head>
               <p>THE Dutch by their Diligence have ballanced my Diſſimulation, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me inſtead of my ſurprizing of them. This is a remarkable Diſgrace to my Brother and me, and will ſtrengthen the former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections that have been made on our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, confirm the World in the belief of the Unſucceſsfulneſs of our Arms, and make my Subjects curſe our Amours, as the fatal Cauſes of all their Ruine. It's true that his Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in this Affair is highly to be blamed, that he ſhould be ſo intent on the ſatisfying of his Paſſion for a Woman, when his chief Paſſion ought to have been the acquiring of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Honour for me and himſelf, by executing Vengeance on the Heretical Dutch: But why ſhould I upbraid him with it, ſeeing this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98018:85"/> Temper is hereditary to him and me both? I muſt excuſe it to the People as the Fortune of War; and in the mean time comfort my ſelf with the Succeſs of my Allies the French, who have well nigh over-run them by Land, though they have had the better of me by Sea; and that Element does now triumph over their Country, upon which they ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly triumph'd over me, they being under a neceſſity of drowning their Territories, as having no other way to ſave them from their Enemies.</p>
               <p>That I may the better accompliſh my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon them, I muſt take care, if poſſible, to divide them, and for that end will publiſh a Declaration, inviting ſuch of them as are either well affected to me, or weary of the Oppreſſion which they groan under at home, to come hither, with their Effects and Ships, to <hi>England,</hi> where they ſhall enjoy the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of my natural Subjects: And as this will create a Jealouſy amongſt themſelves, and occaſion a general and mutual Diſtruſt, ſo it will in ſome meaſure take off the bad Opinion which my Subjects may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of me for engaging in this War againſt their Proteſtant Neighbours. And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Fanatical Murmurs which have a tendency that way, I will iſſue a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, forbidding all publick Diſcourſe amongſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98018:86"/> the People on that Subject. And to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their Ruine, I'll ſend over new Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries to the States, under a pretence of concerting Meaſures to ſtop the Progreſs of the French Conqueſts, but really to aſſure them in what they have got, and to prevent their depriving me of my due ſhare, leſt <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV treat me as <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Lion treated his Fellow-Hunters, who would be ſatisfied with no leſs Dividend than the whole. By this Means I ſhall ſtill bring ſome of the weaker ſort to have a good Opinion of me; and in the mean time ſhall have the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to attempt the bringing off of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> from the States, by putting him in hopes of enjoying the Soveraignty, while my Plenipotentiaries ſhall have Inſtructions to take care that my Intereſt be aſſured with the French King; and then when both of us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon high Terms, the Dutch muſt either ſubmit or be undone.</p>
               <p>Though Plots be well laid, they don't al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hold, for the Dutch continue refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, let us do what we can. I thought that my Intereſt and Authority might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with my young Nephew the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> eſpecially when tempted with the Proffer of Soveraignty; but I find he is Proof againſt all ſuch Allurements: the Blood of the Family of <hi>Naſſau</hi> has got the Aſcendant
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98018:86"/> in him; ſo that I am afraid there's not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Alloy of mine: I doubt that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence will prove, that my Mother's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of her eldeſt Daughter, inſtead of being ſerviceable to her Deſign, will utterly ruine it; for that Family ſeems to be deſtin'd for the Bane of unlimited Prerogative, and they have for a long time been the invincible Champions of the Northern Hereſy. I do alſo foreſee an impending Storm from the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> upon me and <hi>France,</hi> as if the Fates had reſolv'd to turn the World up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down, and make that Family which did propagate the Catholick Religion with ſo much Zeal a Bulwark now for the Defence of Hereſy. It's ſtrange that the Emperor, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had intimation that the Deſign of this War was to root out Hereſy from the Weſtern World, ſhould yet oppoſe me and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>France:</hi> but let the greateſt of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots pretend what they will, I find that their Intereſt is their chief Religion, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms me in the Opinion that the whole of Religion is a Cheat.</p>
               <p>However, I reſolve to go on with my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, and back my Brother the French King in his Demands of a full Liberty to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks, not only to profeſs their Religion openly, but alſo to enjoy the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Churches. And that this may be the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98018:87"/> better effected, I muſt ſtand by him till he have the beſt of the Towns which he hath taken from the Dutch aſcertained to him, and a yearly Gratuity, the Payment of which may reduce them to Poverty. For my own part, I reſolve to inſiſt upon having the Flag, and that they ſhall ſtrike to me on their own Coaſts, that ſo I may aſſure my ſelf of the Dominion of the Seas; and ſome of their beſt Towns I will demand for Security, that they ſhall faithfully perform their Contracts with me, to pay me a Million for by-paſt Damages, and 10000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for their fiſhing on my Coaſts. By this Means I doubt not but a fatal Blow may be given to thoſe Heretical Republicans, and the Family of <hi>Orange</hi> quite deſtroy'd, to the great Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all good Catholicks, to whom they have been irreconcileable Enemies: and I can eaſily wipe off the Odium, by charging the Prince with Ingratitude for the Royal Favours beſtowed on him by my Family.</p>
               <p>But I find that the ſtubborn Dutch are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be frightned nor flattered, now that they have declared the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> their Stadtholder. Nor could they give a greater Inſtance of their bidding Defiance to <hi>France,</hi> than by maſſacring the <hi>De Witts,</hi> who were thought to be its Penſioners. There's no doubt but that they will look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98018:87"/> as betrayed by me, when I ſent over Plenipotentiaries on pretence to favour them; and that yet I ſhould enter into a new Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>France</hi> againſt them: and they will exclaim againſt my Unkindneſs to my Kinſman the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> but they may remember that the French Maſſacre was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on under pretence of an Alliance with the head of the Proteſtants; and that it can be no Crime for ſo near Deſcendants of the Royal Family of <hi>France,</hi> as I and my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to follow ſo great an Example of our Predeceſſors. The matching of my Siſter with the Family of <hi>Orange,</hi> was deſign'd as a Kindneſs to our ſelves, and not to them: So that if they do not anſwer our Deſign on their part, it's but reaſonable that there ſhould be a Breach on ours: And ſeeing the Dutch by their Example and Incouragement bid defiance to my Arms in ſo contemptuous a manner, it's but reaſonable that I ſhould cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe them for their Inſolence, and not ſit down patiently under ſuch a Diminution of my Glory; and I doubt not but my Brother of <hi>France</hi> and I ſhall find Means to ſtir up the Biſhops of <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> who are Neighbours to the Dutch, and conſequently the greateſt Haters of them, both becauſe of their Form of Government and Hereſy, to take part with us againſt the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:98018:88"/> And to prevent the Proteſtants Belief that the chief Deſign is againſt their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall influence the Duke of <hi>Hanover,</hi> by our Gold, to join with us; and he being a Proteſtant, it will make our Deſign the leſs perceptible.</p>

               <p>HOW uncomfortable is it for a Monarch to be limited, and not to have the Purles of his Subjects at command? for him to be obliged to uſe Intreaties to his People, who ought to receive his Dictates without Controul? But Neceſſity has no Law, the Conſtitution of this Government being ſuch,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98018:88"/> that Engliſh Kings are but a ſort of Royal Beggars. I muſt try if my Parliament will let me have Money now that I am diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as to my Hopes of ſeizing the Dutch <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plate Fleets; and that my Supplies from <hi>France</hi> come but ſlowly in. I know that they are jealous of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, have an envious Eye at my Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and are particularly ſtartled at the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing Power, therefore I muſt ſweeten them by my Speech, and indeavour to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them with an Opinion that my Deſign therein was only to ſecure my ſelf from Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Inſurrections at home, while I was engaged in a War abroad, which cannot be thought an unreaſonable Fear by any think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man, conſidering the Troubles which the Puritanical Party gave to my Father. And as to their Objection, that more Favour has been ſhewn to Papiſts than Diſſenters, I can eaſily anſwer it, that the latter are abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more Loyal than the former, and have been faſt Friends both to my Father and my ſelf; and yet they were only allowed their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in private, whereas the other Party had theirs in publick: but as for diſpenſing with the Executive Part of the Law, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to hold it as long as I can. Their Fears that I ſhall make uſe of the Forces which I raiſe to ſubvert their Liberty and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98018:89"/> Property, I muſt endeavour to diſpel by fair Promiſes, and the Intereſt of my Clergy and Penſioners; and at the ſame time poſſeſs them with a Neceſſity of my raiſing more Forces for the Honour and Defence of the Nation, that we may not be inſulted over by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Dutch, whom my Predeceſſor Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did raiſe from the Duſt. I have cull'd out the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> for Lord Chancellor, who may do me very great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, becauſe a Popular Man; ſo that I ſhall make uſe of his Influence and Eloquence both to palliate my having ſhut up the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, and to demonſtrate the Neceſſity of a War with the Dutch, and at the ſame time of granting an Indulgence to the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>I perceive that the bad Influences of my Stars are not yet exhauſted; for though I lay my Deſigns with all imaginable Policy, they do often miſcarry. Who would have thought that ſo many fair Promiſes, back'd with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Eloquence, and the Intereſt and Influence of my Penſioners, ſhould have miſcarried in Parliament? and yet, to my great Regret, I do find that it has; ſo that nothing will ſerve but a renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of my Diſpenſing Power, and freſh Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, that never any thing of that Nature ſhall be attempted again; which, rather than want Money, I am reſolv'd to comply with:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98018:89"/> for if I could but once get a Standing Army on foot, I ſhould ſoon be able to retrieve it. And in the mean time I ſhall take care to have all this Clamour againſt the Diſpenſing Power and Standing Army imputed to the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and envious Surmiſes of the Phanaticks and Republicans. And from this Obligation laid upon me to recal my Act of Indulgence, I ſhall at leaſt reap this Advantage, that it will heighten the Animoſities betwixt the Diſſenters and Church-men; for I can eaſily bring it about to have the Refuſal of it wholly imputed to the latter: And though I have no reaſon to be well ſatisfy'd at the Check which is hereby put upon my Prerogative, yet it hath thus much of a Cordial in it, that I perceive the Epiſcopal Party wholly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable to the Presbyterians, which at ſome time or other will very much forward my grand Deſign: and at preſent it has had ſo much Influence as to procure me a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sum; though, to avoid the Reproaches of the Phanatical Party, the Parliament won't own that it is for carrying on the War againſt the Dutch, but to ſupply my extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Occaſions.</p>
               <p>If it were not that I queſtion the Being of a Deity, I ſhould be apt to conclude that God fights for the Hollanders, who have obtain'd ſome freſh Advantages againſt me at Sea:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98018:90"/> and though they labour under the greateſt of Preſſures that can be, they do alſo make good their Cauſe againſt the Power of <hi>France</hi> by Land. And thoſe pernicious Hereticks being ſenſible of the Apprehenſions which my Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament have, that the Conſequences of this War may be fatal to the Proteſtant Intereſt, they have taken the moſt effectual Method that can be to poſſeſs that Heretical Divan, that the French King and my ſelf aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than the Subverſion of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Liberties of their State, with that of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands.</hi> Nor have I any other way to ſave my ſelf from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of this Accuſation, than by inſiſting on the neceſſity of deſtroying thoſe States to preſerve our own Trade, and to prevent the Incouragement which they give to thoſe who are Enemies to the eſtabliſh'd Diſcipline of our Church.</p>
               <p>There is but too much Truth in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proverb, That after one Miſchief comes another, for ſo I find it by ſad Experience. Though the Dutch and the Phanatical Party be both of them hated by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet they have Influence enough to foment Jealouſies in the Parliament, that their Religion and Liberty are both in danger: And hence comes the Addreſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons againſt my Brother's Match with the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98018:90"/> Dutcheſs of <hi>Modena,</hi> becauſe a Catholick Princeſs, and propoſed by the French King. 'Tis true that this may indeed ſeem inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with my reiterated Proteſtations of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all imaginable Care to ſecure the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion and the Peoples Liberties: but amongſt ſo many Conceſſions I may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly venture on one Dram of Prerogative, and tell them, that the Marriage is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by my Authority, that in Honour I cannot be worſe than my Word; and if this will not ſatisfy them, I'll cool them by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation.</p>
               <p>What ill Fate is this that attends all my Meaſures! I did reaſonably hope that this Prorogation would have diverted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons from inſiſting on their Addreſs againſt my Brother's Match; but it ſeems that the Jealouſy which they have conceiv'd has taken deeper Root than to be pull'd up ſo ſoon, and therefore I find my ſelf under a neceſſity to prorogue them again, ſeeing they preſs me ſo hard to diſſolve the Match, becauſe hitherto only concluded by Proxy. They are become very ſagacious, and diſcern that this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age will engage me in new Alliances, which may be dangerous to the Proteſtant Religion: and that the Princeſs having ſo many Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Secrets of my Court muſt needs be open to them, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98018:91"/> therefore they are about to render Catholicks uncapable of ſitting in either Houſe of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament: but this is too much for me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede; and if granted, would ruine my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign intirely; and therefore I muſt find out ſome Method to divert the Current, which I cannot attempt with hopes of ſo much Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs any other way, as that of laying the whole Burden upon the Fanaticks, and the Suggeſtions of the Dutch, it being both their Intereſts to create Differences betwixt the Parliament and me; and that therefore I thought fit to prorogue them, that they may have time for ſecond and more moderate Thoughts, becauſe the Enemy would reap more Advantage from our Diviſions than they could flatter themſelves with the hopes of from their own Arms; and that therefore it's more their Intereſt to ſecure me and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from our only Competitors and Rivals at Sea abroad, and the Fanaticks, who are the Brands of inteſtine Diſcord at home, the preſent Evils under which we labour, than to trouble themſelves about ſuch remote Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences as the Fears of the Growth of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, becauſe of my Brother's marrying with a Catholick Princeſs: And in the mean time, that my Friends amongſt the Clergy and others, who will certainly eſpouſe the Defence of my Practice, may have Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98018:91"/> for plauſible Arguments, I will publiſh a Proclamation for putting the Laws in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt Papiſts, forbid them my own Court, and that of my Brother; which, though it may ſeem very hard and ſevere up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our good Friends the Roman Catholicks, yet none of them, who are Men of Thoughts, will be much offended at it, when they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he and I both have choſen Wives of that Religion; and eſpecially that I take care to have my Brother's Marriage ſolemniz'd the very next day after the Proclamation. And to cut off all Pretence of Excuſe from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whom I deſign to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the Cauſe with my ſelf, the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſhall be conſummated by one of their own Biſhops at <hi>Dover,</hi> that Place being already famous for the Alliance which broke the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple League, on the Influence of my Siſter the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans.</hi> And thus I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve my late Loſſes, and ſtrengthen my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances with <hi>France,</hi> by matching my Brother with an adopted Daughter of that Crown, there being no more reaſon for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's oppoſing of the Match with this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Princeſs, than that which was talk'd of with the Arch-dutcheſs of <hi>Inſpruck:</hi> Whence I perceive, that though the Clamour to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Populace be the Danger of Religion, yet there's nothing but Policy and Intereſt at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98018:92"/> bottom: and that they thought an Alliance with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> not ſo dangerous to their own Liberties, as one with the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon:</hi> and their Argument from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath receiv'd a mortal Wound, when the Bill that Engliſh Princes ſhould marry none but Proteſtants was thrown out of the Houſe of Lords by the unanimous Vote of the Biſhops Bench, though their Lordſhips, at the ſame time, did as unanimouſly vote for a Teſt to make their own Form of Church-Government unalterable: And certainly if they who call themſelves the Fathers of the Proteſtant Church have ſo little Zeal for the Main of their Religion, I may be allowed a greater Latitude on that Head, and even to oppoſe it when thoſe ghoſtly Fathers have given Inſtructions to their Clergy, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Diſſenter as a more dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my than the Papiſt.</p>

               <p>By the Vote of the Commons for Eaſe to Proteſtant Diſſenters, I perceive that they are now jealous that thoſe Penal Laws were at firſt framed for the deſtruction of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Intereſt: but ſeeing they have denied me the Privilege of diſpenſing with thoſe Laws, I ſhall take care to have them kept on foot; and this will be ſufficient to render all their Efforts againſt me faint and of no effect, which would be formidable enough if the Strength of the Proteſtants were united: And whereas they think that they have done mighty things in excluding Papiſts from Places of Power and Truſt by their Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Teſt, it demonſtrates ſufficiently how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they are acquainted with the Principles or Practices of the Catholicks, who can have a Diſpenſation to do what they pleaſe for the advancement of their Intereſt. And that, moreover, there are abundance of Church-Papiſts, who make no Scruple of Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whereas the Diſſenting Proteſtants, who are the greateſt Enemies to my Meaſures, cannot comply with the ſaid Teſt: ſo that inſtead of excluding their Enemies, they ſhut out their Fellow-Proteſtants; or at leaſt will
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98018:94"/> be ſure to manage it ſo as to make it have that Effect; and I doubt not to reap very good Advantage from this Method, and to make it appear to the common Obſerver, that this manner of Procedure is wholly (as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in a great part) owing to the Rancour of the Epiſcopal Party, and not to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Court: for I make no queſtion but that the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Clergy will ſpeedily take the Alarm of the Hazard that threatens their Conſtitution, if once Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have Eaſe, and be admitted into the Church; ſo that my Enemies are not aware of my Advantage againſt them, by having the Pulpits of the Nation on my ſide. By the Influence of the Biſhops, who depend ſo much upon me, I can make the Pulpits ſpeak in the Court-Dialect, and libel the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Commons as the Reſult of Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Republican Conſults; which being pronounced <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> and having the Shadow of Divine Authority, and that of the Civil Magiſtrate, to back it, will have a more univerſal Effect than their private Murmurings in Clubs and Conventicles. And though this Teſt may in ſome meaſure incommode the bigotted Catholicks in my Service at home; yet I will order it ſo as it ſhall not reach thoſe who are in my Service abroad; and there I can have a Nurſery of

               </p>
               <p>The imprudent Zeal of Mr. <hi>Richard Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi> who glories in being Agent to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks in <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath animated them not only to addreſs againſt him, but againſt imploying any Catholicks in <hi>Ireland,</hi> either as Officers or Souldiers. Nor do they ſtop there, but deſire that I ſhould recal my Commiſſion of Inquiry into Iriſh Affairs, as tending to the Overthrow of the Act of Settlement; and the like as to my Letter, forbidding the Proſecution of the Iriſh for any Injuries they committed in the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; and urge me to baniſh their Titular

I thought it the beſt Policy to begin to exert my Prerogative in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by extending Favour to the Catholicks there, who did ſo cordially eſpouſe my Father's Quarrel againſt the Puritanical Rebels both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> concluding, as I thought with Reaſon, that the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-men would have been willing that the Iriſh Catholicks, who were their Fellow-Sufferers in Affliction, ſhould alſo be Fellow-Sharers with them in their Proſperity after my Reſtoration; and that thoſe who had no Scruple of Conſcience to join with them in Arms againſt their common Enemies the Presbyterians, even after they were accounted barbarous for maſſacring the Proteſtants, ſhould have had no Diſquiet at ſeeing them Copartners with themſelves in my Royal Bounty: but I find that I am miſtaken, and that the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calculated to the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, but has no place when that is not the Monarch's chief Aim; for they not only take upon them to quarrel with my Proclamations and Letters about the Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98018:96"/> pretend to order who ſhall have Acceſs to my Court, and who not, as if the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was to be confin'd to as narrow Limits as the Doge of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſo ill founded are thoſe Peoples Complaints againſt the Scots Presbyterians, for impoſing Conditions upon me before my Coronation; that they themſelves who admitted me almoſt without any, are now for intrenching upon my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative when I am in plenary Poſſeſſion: And yet becauſe of this pretended Conſtraint upon me, the Epiſcopal Party juſtify my Breach of Covenant with the Scots; ſo that according to their own Doctrine I may as well break with themſelves when I find an Opportunity, becauſe they now take the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my Circumſtances and want of Money to bring me to their own Terms, which is ſtill more palpable from their other Addreſs concerning their own Grievances, <hi>viz.</hi> my impoſing of 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Chaldron up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Coals, for providing of Convoys; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting of my Souldiers from ordinary Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; the quartering of them on private Houſes; the preſſing of Men for Land-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that notwithſtanding of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right of Succeſſion, my not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to any but God, and the Height to which their Divines have preach'd up my Prerogative, they would ſtill reduce me to a

Theſe things being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Principles, I muſt take care to poſſeſs the Clergy of the Danger they are in if ſuch Incroachments upon the Crown be ſuffered to paſs without Animadverſion: for as they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue themſelves upon the Maxim of <hi>No Biſhop, no King;</hi> as if where Epiſcopacy is not the Government of the Church, Monarchy can never be that of the State; I am ſure that the converted Propoſition, <hi>No King no Biſhop,</hi> will hold much truer: And if once there be an Incroachment made upon the Crown, the Privileges of the Mitre will never be laſting; and therefore it's their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to diſown the Maintainers of ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for true Sons of the Church, as I can never own them for good Subjects to the State; and ſo we ſhall brand them with a Note of Ignominy: But in the mean time I muſt put the Commons off with a ſmooth Anſwer, both my Father and I having ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſmarted by provoking Parliaments, though at the ſame time I ſhall be ſure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue them, that ſo all their Deſigns of Eaſe to Diſſenters, and to oppoſe my Brother's Match, may fall to the ground; and this I eſteem a much ſafer way of dealing, than to withdraw from them, and ſet up my Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, as my Father did, who ſeems to have
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98018:97"/> entail'd his Misfortune in War on all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; for I find that the Minds of thoſe who depend intirely upon me are mutable, and therefore I have leſs Reaſon to put Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Body of the Nation, who brag of their Privileges as a free People. The Church-men, notwithſtanding of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Flights of Zeal for the Prerogative, do many of them join with thoſe who are for encroaching upon it; and my very Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who liv'd by my Bounty, withſtood my Deſigns of having a Power to levy Money upon extraordinary Occaſions, and getting an univerſal Exciſe ſettled upon the Crown, becauſe they found that if theſe things were but once obtain'd, there would be no need of Penſioners, and conſequently an End put to their Salaries and Subſiſtence. Nor are even the higheſt of the Clergy, who bind Paſſive Obedience upon the Conſciences of their Hearers, on pain of Damnation, willing to have an Arbitrary Power put in exerciſe over themſelves: and the moſt obſequious of their Hearers, though they applaud the French King and his Government, are very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have it introduc'd here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concur with the Phanatical Members to oppoſe the keeping up of a Standing Army; and as they have excluded their Brethren the Diſſenters, they are alſo unwilling that the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98018:98"/> Roman Catholicks ſhould be Sharers with them in Places of Power and Truſt: ſo that my Epiſcopal Subjects are indeed very Loyal, but it's on this Condition, that they alone may enjoy the Bag; and if either I, or any of my Succeſſors ſhall put out our hands and touch them in their Property, I make no doubt of it but they will curſe us to our Face; and therefore I muſt take care to drive on cunningly but not furiouſly, ſo that when I have a mind to be reveng'd on any of my Enemies, I muſt repreſent them as Fanaticks and Commonwealths-Men; then ſhall I be ſure to have them baited from the Pulpits, nor ſhall they find any more favourable Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they come before the Benches.</p>

               <p>MY Caſe is very deſperate when I muſt have recourſe to the Pooreſt of my Subjects for Money, and that the Richeſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98018:98"/> refuſe it. My Father and Grandfather took ſuch Meaſures as tended to the keeping of <hi>Scotland</hi> low; ſo that it's no wonder that that Nation ſhould have fail'd them in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. They were obliged by their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Oaths to live ſome part of their time there, leſt the Subſtance of the Kingdom ſhould be ſpent in <hi>England</hi> by the Nobilities being obliged to frequent the Court: but Reaſons of State induc'd them to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for the Scots being a People tenacious of their Privileges, and zealous for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, did oppoſe their Meaſures for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Prerogative; whence it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to humble them, leſt their Example ſhould have had bad Influence on the two other Kingdoms. My Father, it's true, would have proceeded further, and deſign'd to have chaſtis'd their Contumacy with the Sword; but how unſucceſsful it proved in the Event, is too late and recent to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: their Kindneſs to me was truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in declaring me their King imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon his Murder; but I am afraid that my treatment of them ſince hath effac'd thoſe good Impreſſions which they had of me then, ſeeing I have not only overturn'd the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, who were at that time my greateſt Friends, but cut off the Chief of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and brought the whole Party under the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98018:99"/> laſh. Curſed be the Neceſſity which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions my application to them, and may thoſe Diſciples of Paſſive Obedience, the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of-<hi>England</hi>-Men, be dealt with in the ſame manner as they have dealt with me. They pretended to receive me without any previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Terms, and to own the Divine Right of my Succeſſion to the Throne; but now when I have ſettled the Diſcipline of their Church, and brought the Diſſenters under their feet, they are alſo for diſputing my Commands, and confining my Prerogative within nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower Limits. I muſt now try whether their Brethren, the Epiſcopal Party in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will be any thing more ingenuous, and if they can really perform what they have ſo ſolemnly promiſed, they have undertaken to aſſiſt me with 22000 Horſe and Foot where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall have occaſion; then ſurely they may let me have the Money and ſave their Men, which would do my buſineſs in an effectual Manner: and that no means may be left unattempted, I will ſend the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> their great Patron, to perſwade them to it.</p>
               <p>But my curſed Fate continues inauſpicious, and I find that the Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> are very inſignificant, being not ſo much as able to grant me one Subſidy; but inſtead of that, I am preſented with an Addreſs of their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98018:99"/> Grievances, and a ſmart Remonſtrance againſt <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s Miniſtry, back'd by the greateſt of the Peers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Noiſe and Complaints have reach'd me in <hi>England;</hi> and until thoſe be redreſſed, they won't ſo much as hear of any Overtures for Money. I was made to believe that an unbounded Loyalty had been ſo univerſally diffuſed through that Kingdom, that the Epiſcopal Party ador'd, and the Presbyterians fear'd me; but Experience teaches the contrary, elſe what means this bleating of the Sheep and lowing of the Oxen? the Epiſcopal Party though they alone are capable of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Parliament, either cannot or will not give me Money, and their Libel of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances are but an old Presbyterian Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance newly vamp'd, being an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Adminiſtration both in Church and State, and including Deſires in favour of the Diſſenters. They complain of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of Salt, which hath increaſed the price of it ſo much, that what was formerly had for 4, cannot now be bought for <hi>20s.</hi> though the Inconvenience of this Monopoly was repreſented to me. They do alſo mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt the Impoſitions on Brandy and Tobacco; and that the Lords of the Articles who were originally no more than a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Parliament's appointment, are
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98018:100"/> now advanc'd above Parliaments themſelves: That the Mint and Coinage are corrupted: Perſons ignorant and inſufficient created Judges: That the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and others of the Clergy are countenanc'd in preaching reflectingly upon the Parliament: That Magiſtrates are illegally impoſed upon the City of <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> That eminent Offices are accumulated upon ſingle Perſons; and conclude this Point with the Male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of my Revenue, and the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s exceſſive Greatneſs. In the next place they complain of the Severity of the Laws againſt the Presbyterians, and that my own Power is too great in Church-Affairs: ſo that the Nations ſeem reſolved to join Complaints againſt my Government; and how fatal the Iſſue of that may be, I can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conjecture from by-paſt times; therefore I muſt diſmiſs Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> with a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anſwer, and promiſe a Redreſs of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in Parliament, that ſo I may allay their preſent Heat. 'Tis happy for me that I have two other Kingdoms by which I can overawe them, or elſe their Addreſs had been back'd by the Sword, and they would probably have brought me on my Knees before their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they have done ſeveral of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, or have cut off my Head; but I ſhall henceforth endeavour to put them out
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98018:100"/> of a Capacity to deal ſo by me or any of my Succeſſors. And whereas the Presbyterians do tenaciouſly adhere to the pretended Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of their Fore-fathers, inſtead of Rods, by which they were chaſtis'd by my Father, I ſhall henceforth order it ſo that they ſhall be puniſh'd with Scorpions, that they may be rendred altogether unable to raiſe any Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion at home, or aſſiſt the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> abroad. I will take ſuch effectual Courſe to render them contemptible, that they ſhall not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth have the Vanity, as in my Father's time, to think that the Repreſentation of their Preſſures can find any Acceptance with their ancient Allies of <hi>France,</hi> to whom they recommended themſelves formerly by their Military Services; ſo that at once I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon them the Blood of all my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors whom they have murdered, and turn the beſt of their Country into a Hunting Field. And herein I doubt not of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, or at leaſt Connivance of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Nation, becauſe of the ancient Enmity betwixt the two Kingdoms; and if once the Scots be ſubjected, I ſhall with the more Eaſe bring <hi>England</hi> under the Yoke.</p>

               <p>MY Stars ſeem to threaten me with a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of bad Influences; I can neither have Money from my Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> nor <hi>England,</hi> nor yet the wonted Supplies from <hi>France:</hi> and now the Spaniards are not only become Mediators, but threaten me if I continue the War with the Dutch. What a mighty Change is this, that they who did formerly ſeek their Deſtruction, ſhould now interpoſe for their Preſervation, and treat their formerly Rebel-Subjects with that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which is due to the beſt of their Allies: And that his Catholick Majeſty, whoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors were the greateſt Champions for Popery and Abſolute Monarchy, ſhould now
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98018:101"/> become the Patron of Hereticks and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans. I may hence obſerve, that Princes purſue different Meaſures, according to their different Intereſts, and ſupport thoſe at one time, whom at another they ſeek to deſtroy. The Spaniard, though eſteem'd the moſt bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Papiſt, yet prefers his Intereſt to his Religion, and thinks it better to ſave the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Dutch, than to periſh with them; and to preſerve their Commonwealth, rather than to loſe a Limb of his own Monarchy. And ſeeing all the Neighbouring Monarchs purſue what they think their different Intereſts, and <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> by ſuch Methods as they themſelves think beſt, I may certainly be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to purſue my Pleaſures, which I reckon my chief Happineſs, by ſuch Methods as I my ſelf think convenient.</p>
               <p>The Dutch take advantage from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of my Subjects, and labour to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Jealouſies betwixt them and me; and according to their Republican Humour, would make the Parliament judg of my Actions, whereby they would inſinuate themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Peoples Favour, and blacken my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns as much as they can.</p>
               <p>Accordingly I do find that they have their Aim, and the Commons have declared their Sentiments for a Peace; ſo unhappy a thing it is when the Head and the Members don't
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98018:102"/> agree, and that Soveraign and Subjects drive different Deſigns. I muſt try what Influence a Speech will have upon the Commons, when larded with Promiſes of ſecuring their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Property; and tell them, that our Enemies place their greateſt Hopes in our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; and ſeeing they prepare for a War, it will be very diſhonourable for the Engliſh Nation to be threatned into a Peace, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeeing the beſt way to procure an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Peace is to treat with the Sword in hand, and to have a good Fleet ready to oppoſe them, which cannot be effected without a large Supply. I have alſo taken care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Houſe as to my Treaties with <hi>France,</hi> of which they have had hitherto very fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Repreſentations, but cannot prevail with them to believe what I ſay, ſo far have their Jealouſies got the Aſcendant over them, that Popery and Arbitrary Government are ready to break in upon them; wherein the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> proves a very ill Inſtrument, and foments their Jealouſies by diſcovering my Intrigues, ſo miſchievous a thing is it when great Courtiers fall off from their Duty; ſo that now the Commons will liſten to nothing without a firm Security for their Religion and Property: and the better to inſinuate to the People the greatneſs of their Danger, they have made application to me to appoint a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98018:102"/> Faſt, deſire that the Trainbands of <hi>London</hi> may be raiſed to ſuppreſs the tumultuous Meetings of the Papiſts, and accuſe my chief Miniſters of Deſigns againſt the Nation, for which they would have them baniſh'd my Preſence for ever. Theſe are woful Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to which I am reduc'd, and afford me but a melancholy Subject of Meditation, when I conſider what Pains and Expence I have been at to deliver the Nations from the Bigotry of Religion, by teſtifying how little I value it in my own Practice, and how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful I have been to diſcourage it in others; that now when my Parliament hath concurr'd with me for ſo many Years, to ruine their diſſenting Brethren at home, and Proteſtant Neighbours abroad, they ſhould at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come refractory and obſtinate, and from an over-heated Zeal for Religion purſue the ſame Meaſures themſelves which they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in others. I reckon'd that the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of a Licentiouſneſs in Practice, would at laſt have extinguiſh'd all Senſe of that which they call Religion; but the Event ſhews that I am miſtaken. The Phanaticks, whom I have proſecuted, will ſay, that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God hath purſu'd me, and created a Difference betwixt me and my Parliament, who did ſo unanimouſly concur to promote their Ruine; and this Cant they will buz
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98018:103"/> and ſpread about the Nation, and value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Foreſight, as having ſo long ago foretold what is now come to paſs; and by this Means work upon the preſent Fears and Ferment of the Nation: but I ſhall fall upon a Method to be even with them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and infallibly turn the Tables upon them. In the mean time I muſt make the beſt Improvement of my preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that I can; and ſeeing there is no avoiding of a Peace with the Dutch, I muſt ſeek for a Pretence to come off with Honour, for which the Marquiſs de <hi>Freſno</hi>'s Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, in name of his Catholick Majeſty, come very opportunely: for ſeeing they are new Propoſals, I can eaſily give out that they are more advantagious than the former; and by ſeeming to adviſe with the Commons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be meet for me to accept of them or not, I ſhall both pleaſe them, and ſalve my own Reputation, for my Allies the French will by this Means ſee that my concluding of Peace is the Effect of Conſtraint, and not of Choice, ſeeing I can neither have Money nor the Parliament's Conſent to carry on the War: and if the French King ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that I act diſhonourably in concluding a Peace without him, it will be a plauſible An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that I am not Abſolute as he is: So that having neither Men nor Money at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98018:103"/> without my Parliament's Concurrence, I am under a Neceſſity of diſcontinuing a War, which they are againſt: And ſeeing he hath fail'd me in his promiſed Supplies, he cannot be angry that I ſeek for them elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, it being every whit as reaſonable that I ſhould ſatisfy my own Pleaſures, as it is for him to gratify his Ambition. And ſeeing my Parliament have very bad Impreſſions of the Treaties betwixt him and me, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining myſterious and dangerous Articles, it's but reaſonable that I ſhould draw a Vail over their Eyes, by ſeeming now to come to an abſolute Rupture, that we may afterwards carry on our Deſigns with leſs Suſpicion: but if none of thoſe Reaſons will ſatisfy him, I am not ſolicitous, for I know that he can as little be without me as I can be without him; and that a mutual Friendſhip is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary for the carrying on of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Deſigns; and if he will be diſguſted at this Treatment, he may remember how he forbad me his Dominions at the Inſtance of a Rebel and Uſurper, and how little Care he hath had of my Reputation ever ſince, but hath continually expos'd me both as to the Affair of betraying Monſieur <hi>Rohan,</hi> the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of it to be printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> that he and I engag'd in this War againſt the Dutch, on purpoſe to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98018:104"/> ordering his Squadron to abandon my Fleet in the Day of Battel, and graſping all the Country to himſelf when he over-run the Hollanders by Land, without the leaſt Deſign of making me a Sharer, according to our Agreement. But let him be well or ill pleas'd, I cannot help it: My Parliament have not only teſtify'd their Diſlike of his Alliance, and this preſent War, but have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to attaque me in the Perſons of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who have hitherto been ſo neceſſary both for the promoting of my Prerogative and Pleaſures; and therefore in prudence I am oblig'd to clap up a Peace, not being able to deal both with the Parliament at home, and the Dutch abroad; though I muſt confeſs that it is not without a ſenſible Regret that I muſt perceive both him and my ſelf robb'd of our Prey when it was juſt betwixt our Teeth.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LII.</hi> On his Majeſty's proroguing the Parliament, becauſe of their impeaching his Miniſters, forming Bills againſt Popery, and for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of thoſe of the Royal Family with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and educating their Children in that Religion. Clamours rais'd in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we were running back to 41. The Court's mediating a Peace betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſending 10000 of their own Subjects into the French King's Service.</head>
               <p>IT may be thought ſtrange that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch ſtanch Church-men ſhould be ſo uneaſy with their Soveraign, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their profeſſed Principles wound me ſo furiouſly through the ſides of my Miniſters; they condemn the Puritans for inſiſting ſo much againſt <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Laud,</hi> whereas they themſelves are as violent againſt the Duke of <hi>Buckingam,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Arlington.</hi> Whence I find, that let them pretend what they will, their Loyalty is meaſured by their ſuppoſed Intereſt.</p>
               <p>My being obliged to concede to them in one thing hath emboldned them to preſs upon me to yield in another: So that having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98018:105"/> me to put an End to the War, they are reſolved to deprive me of the Sweets of Peace, and to rob me of thoſe Miniſters in whom I delight, becauſe of their Agreement with me in Practice and Deſign. If I ſuffer them to be brought to trial, it will not only diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others from ſerving me afterward, but endanger both my Reputation and Safety, and bring me to Repentance when it is too late, as my Father did after he abandoned <hi>Strafford.</hi> I muſt not therefore run ſuch a risk, for if I leave them to the Vengeance of the Commons, they will ſecure themſelves by accuſing me, and conſequently break all my Meaſures, therefore it is neceſſary for me to prorogue the Parliament; and if I can be otherwiſe ſupplied with Money, ſhall never call them more, but rid my ſelf of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Divan, who are an ungrateful Check upon all Monarchs. My Father found, by ſad Experience, the miſchievous Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of making uſe of them; and what King is there who will not be eaſily convinc'd of the danger of having ſuch an Aſſembly to controul them in their Deſigns, dive into their Secrets, and chain up their Hands, that I muſt neither favour what Religion I think fit, marry what Wife I pleaſe, nor make ſuch Alliances as I think advantagious, and for my Intereſt, without their Conſent,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98018:105"/> and Limits, or rather Fetters of their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing? And thus my ill-natured Subjects do continually ſtun my Ears with their Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours againſt Popery; not that they have any true Regard to the contrary Religion which they profeſs, as may be ſeen by their Practice, but becauſe of their temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Then they break in upon the Peace of my own Family; ſo that I muſt neither gratify a Wife, to ſuffer her to educate a Child in her own Religion, though perhaps the ſame may be alſo moſt agreeable to my own Opinion: Nor muſt any of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or near Relations, be ſuffered to marry with Roman Catholicks, for fear of the dangerous Conſequence to their beloved He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy. And thus though they pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Monarchy is the only Government of Divine Right, and that I hold my Crown from God alone by lineal Succeſſion, they load me with ſuch Fetters that they convert my Diadem to a Crown of Thorns; and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable ſoever a Throne may ſeem to be, yet by thoſe Reſtraints they would make it ſweeter to the Fancy than the Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>This dangerous Temper muſt be obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in time, and a Method found out to divert their Zeal, and give it ſome other Current. The Phanaticks were the laſt who had them under their Feet, and have ſtill a great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98018:106"/> in the Nation; whereas the Catholicks have now been diſpoſſed for an Age, and have no other Proſpect but the Favour of the Court to recover their Footing. Then the Courſe which does naturally offer it ſelf to my View, is to alarm the Nation with the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of relapſing into the Diſorders of 1641. which iſſued in the Deſtruction of the Church and Monarchy. The Puritans uſher'd in their Rebellion by Clamours againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of their Civil Rights by an unlimited Prerogative, and of their Religion by Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in Doctrine and Diſcipline; and that therefore it is a Shame for them who pretend to ſo much Loyalty, and to deſpiſe others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of contrary Principles, to be found tracing their Footſteps. The Clergy, I am ſure, will be ſenſible of the Danger, and will, no doubt, be ready to take the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm; and when the Pulpits are on my ſide, I can diffuſe what Opinions and Notions I pleaſe through the Nation: and if once the Clergy be poſſeſſed with an apprehenſion of the Danger they are in of loſing their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices by the Fanaticks; and that the Gentry, who did formerly ſmart by Sequeſtrations, be effectually put in mind of their former Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and the Probability of running head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the ſame Inconveniencies, by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the Methods which they are now upon;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98018:106"/> I doubt not but the Current will turn as ſtrongly upon the Phanaticks and Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, as it does now againſt the Catholicks and Courtiers, eſpecially when back'd by my Authority, and made the Path-way to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment in Church and State; for I ſhall henceforth take care that none be advanc'd in either, but ſuch as are willing to concur with my Deſigns. For the carrying on of which it is neceſſary that ſome acute Pens be ſet at work to defend my Proceedings, and draw ſuch Vails over them as cannot be ſeen through by ordinary Obſervers.</p>
               <p>It is alſo neceſſary for that end, that I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſome fit Perſons to negotiate a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which as it will be a plauſible Argument of my Averſion to have that Proteſtant State deſtroyed, it will give the French King an Opportunity to concert his Meaſures at leiſure, render his Proteſtants leſs uſeful to him at home, and the eaſier to be deſtroyed, and enable him to aſſiſt me in advancing my Prerogative: for which end he ſhall have 10000 of my Subjects in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who after they have acquired Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Reputation in his Wars, will be uſeful to me for training up others, and be ready at hand to quell my rebellious Subjects, in caſe of inteſtine Troubles.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:98018:107"/>
               <p>The old Cavaliers may be now very uſeful to me; and whereas they have hitherto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of being neglected, I will incite them by hopes of having their old Services re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, to publiſh their former Sufferings afreſh, and declare that the Parliament is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſame Methods which did formerly ruine the Church and the State, by which Means I ſhall bring their Procedure to be hated, and animate the Royaliſts and zealous Church-men againſt them.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. LIII.</hi> On the Meeting of the Parliament again, <hi>April, 1675.</hi> Their falling upon Bills for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Nation, and being diverted by the ſudden bringing in of a Têſt into the Houſe of Lords, to be impoſed upon all in Places of Power or Truſt, Civil, Military or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical; obliging them to declare their Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of taking up Arms againſt the King, or any commiſſionated by him; and to ſwear that they would not at any time endeavour the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Government either in Church or State.</head>
               <p>THE Want of Money obliges me to let the Parliament ſit after ſo long a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation; but, to my great Grief, I perceive
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98018:107"/> that the Vitals and noble Parts of the Nation are in danger by this Contagion of rebellious Principles, which hath rag'd ſo long amongſt them. Inſomuch that whereas it might have been juſtly expected that this long Prorogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould have cool'd them, they fall upon the old Theme of Bills for the Advantage of the Nation; but I am reſolv'd to give them a Diverſion by the Cavalier and High Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom I have inſpir'd with a Deſire of Revenge for old Injuries, and put them in hopes of better Succeſs than formerly, if they ſhould have occaſion of fighting the old Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel over again, ſeeing now they are poſſeſſed of the Arms, Forts and Ammunition of the Nation, and are ſure of one to head them, who will never be guilty of ſuch a precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Action as to leave their Enemies in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>London,</hi> diveſt himſelf of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Militia, or lodg his Power in the Hands of the Parliament. So that the Church and I ſhall mutually gratify one another, and maintain both Monarchy and Epiſcopacy to be of Divine Right, and not to be bounded by humane Laws. We have made conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Steps towards this already; the Act for regulating Corporations hath excluded all Men of different Principles from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy; the Act of Uniformity hath ſhut them out from the Miniſtry; and the Act of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98018:108"/> the Militia hath left them no Place in the Army: So that it only remains for laying on the Top-ſtone of the whole Fabrick, that we get this Teſt to be univerſally impoſed, and then we take away all Opportunity from the Parliament to alter any thing in Church or State, and confine them to their proper Work of raiſing Money. The Biſhops, who have their Dependance upon me, muſt be taught to inſtruct their inferiour Clergy to make uſe of their Learning to juſtify and not to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what their Superiours command: And ſeeing this Oath ſecures their beloved Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Diſcipline to Perpetuity, they can neither in Gratitude nor Intereſt decline their Concurrence to promote the ſame in favour of the Crown; which, with ſo much Zeal, they deſire for the Mitre. If this can be obtain'd, the Act of Oblivion will be made void, and then we can take a ſweet Revenge on the Phanaticks and Republicans. The better to make it paſs, we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to poſſeſs the Parliament, that it's a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and moderate Security for the Church and Crown, and will be the moſt effectual Preſervative that can be thought on againſt ſuch Rebellions as that of 41. The Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it may eaſily be inſtructed from the Swarms of Phanaticks, and Men of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Principles, which abound in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98018:108"/> And all who refuſe to give this moderate Security, ſhall be look'd on as tainted with this rebellious Leaven.</p>
               <p>But I find that I muſt ſtill lay my Account to meet with Oppoſition; for thoſe Lords who value themſelves, as being Patriots to their Country, but in reality a factious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, oppoſe this Bill with Vigour, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching on the Birth-right of the Peers, ſtriking at the Root of the Government, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away Freedom of Debate from the Houſes of Parliament, which have part of the Legiſlative Power, obliging them to abjure all Endeavours to alter the Government of the Church, whatever the Neceſſities of the State, or Chriſtian Compaſſion to Diſſenters may require; and therefore they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt it; but however I have this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that it is carried againſt them, and committed. And my Lords the Biſhops have behav'd themſelves bravely in it, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring not only to have thoſe Proteſting Lords perſonally puniſhed, but the Liberty of exhibiting Reaſons with their Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aboliſhed, becauſe of their pretending a Chriſtian Compaſſion to Diſſenters: Nor did they ſhew themſelves leſs my Friends in rejecting the Proviſo's offer'd by the Proteſting Lords, to ſecure the Freedom of Debate to Members of Parliament, and prevent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98018:109"/> from Popiſh Recuſants. And though they could not anſwer, yet they could out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote the Arguments brought againſt Aſſerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Oaths in point of Doctrine, and Promiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Oaths, though held unlawful by <hi>Grotius;</hi> and generally ineffectual, to keep ill Men out of the Government, though they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſome conſcientious Perſons: And as the Biſhops cannot juſtify this their Procedure, without an aſſurance of Infallibility, which they do not pretend to, it ſhews that they do not believe the Religion which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and teach. And ſeeing I perceive this to be common among Prieſts of all Religions, it cannot but juſtify me, though I ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly profeſs my ſelf to be of none. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Country Lords have found out my Deſign to ſwear them not to oppoſe an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government, by binding them up not to reſiſt my ſelf or any having my Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though I ſhould command them to do things contrary to the ſtanding Laws; as le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of Money without Conſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or though I ſhould either deliver my ſelf up to the French King, or by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of War fall into his Hands, and either willingly or by conſtraint command my Subjects to do ſuch things as are contrary to my Royal Dignity: Or in caſe that a Popiſh Succeſſor ſhould by Force of Arms endeavour
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98018:109"/> to eſtabliſh the Catholick Religion: So that I find the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience, though inculcated from the Pulpit, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Article of Faith, on pain of Hell and Damnation, hath not obtain'd univerſal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief amongſt the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Laity, whatever it hath done amongſt their Clergy, and conſequently that the latter are not fit for me to rely upon, as not being able enough to defend me againſt that Party who prov'd too ſtrong for them and my Father both; for I am now fully ſatisfied that ſuch of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as agree with the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Politicks, would alſo quickly unite with them in Eccleſiaſticks, if they would but allow them a ſufficient Latitude of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: So that hence I have ground enough to perſwade the Clergy to declare againſt all ſuch as Presbyterians in Maſquerade, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Enemies to their Church-Government, which they do not believe to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> elſe they would never boggle at ſwearing not to alter it.</p>
               <p>I have alſo this to comfort me, that I am not ſuſpected alone by thoſe Peers, but the Biſhops do now come in for a ſhare, it being plainly perceiv'd by the contrary Party, that though they took care for their Diſcipline, they took none for their Doctrine, that they might be as good as their Promiſe to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98018:110"/> Lords, that the Oath ſhould be ſo form'd as not to bear hard on them, which is ſtill an Encouragement to me to think better of the Catholick Religion than the Reformed; for the Catholick Clergy I find much truer to their Intereſt than thoſe of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> If the Engliſh Biſhops did believe the Truth of their own Religion, they would certainly be more concerned for its Doctrine than Diſcipline, and not more ſollicitous to ſecure the latter againſt Diſſenters, than the former againſt Catholicks; or if they were Men who made conſcience of Oaths them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would never be for impoſing ſuch Oaths upon others as are contrary to their own Practice: for if they thought it unlawful to endeavour any Alteration in their Church, they would never make choice of ſuch Men for Preferments as Preach and Write againſt her Doctrine of Predeſtination. Thoſe Prelates do exactly reſemble the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, who bound heavy Burdens upon the Shoulders of their Diſciples, while they would not touch them themſelves with one of their Fingers; and ſo, though there have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Alterations made in the Prayers and Rites of the Church ſince the Reformation by them and their Predeceſſors, yet they would oblige others by Oath never to endeavour the like, but to maintain their Church as now

It's true that all this is for my Intereſt, and contributes exceedingly to the advancement of my Deſigns; but at the ſame time, though I love the Treaſon I hate the Traitor, and can put no Confidence in thoſe Men, who being falſe to that which they call their own Intereſt, can never be true to mine: and hence I perceive, that though they profeſs otherwiſe, their Religion is the ſame with my own; for as I purſue my Pleaſures, they purſue their Profits as their <hi>ſummum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> and if they may but acquire it, they care not by what Methods. Who then can blame me for disbelieving that Religion which they who are the Fathers of the Church do manifeſtly disbelieve themſelves? or how can I be blamed for favouring Popery as beſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my Deſigns, when Proteſtant Biſhops approve of their Ordination, Canons, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Government, and by the choice which they make of Eccleſiaſticks for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and the Tenderneſs which they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98018:111"/> have ſhew'd to the Catholicks in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Teſt, it's evident enough that they have no diſlike to their Doctrines. However, I am in a great meaſure obliged to them for ſtanding by me in this Point, though I perceive their principal Motive was to have their own Government rendred as Abſolute as my own; and that it ſhould be equally, if not more dangerous for any Man to mutter againſt the Church, as it is to ſpeak Treaſon againſt the State. However if this Oath could be paſs'd, I ſhould be happy in my Government, and rendred abundantly more Abſolute, than now I can pretend to be; the preſent Oath of Allegiance and the Laws not being comprehenſive enough, but load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ungrateful Reſtrictions. And as for the Biſhops, I know how to deal with them if ever they ſhould happen to grow uneaſy; the Wounds of my Sword will be ſooner felt than thoſe of their Paſtoral Staff; and having rendred themſelves unacceptable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by concurring ſo much with the Court, and being ſo violent againſt Diſſenters, they cannot well recover their Intereſt there, and ſo muſt be forc'd to comply with me; by which means I can eaſily protect the Crown againſt the Efforts of the Mitre.</p>

However, I am obliged to the good Will of the Biſhops, who do herein behave themſelves like true and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects, and adviſe the Lords to quit their Pretenſions, though thereby they lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves open to Laſhes, as concurring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that Government; the Preſervation of which for ever, without any endeavour of Alteration, they did ſo much preſs to have the People ſworn to: but herein they act

The Lords, however, are deaf to all Inſinuations, either from the Danger of a Rupture with the Commons or me at this Juncture, which puts me under a Neceſſity of proroguing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and rather to hazard the Loſs of the Teſt, than the Quiet of my Government: for I find that Kings have always been Loſers, whenever they came to a War with their Barons and People; and I am not without Reaſon to think that this Debate betwixt the two Houſes is rather fomented to obſtruct the Teſt, than out of any Kindneſs to my Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, which is ſufficiently evident from the inconſiderable Subſidy which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons have voted me.</p>

               <p>HAving, during this Interval of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taken ſufficient Care to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Danger of open Rebellion, ſuch as that in 1641. if the Parliament perſiſt in their late Methods, and to make all thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſuch Sums as I think beſt to deſire, odious to the Church as Presbyterians, I thought fit to let them meet again, to try whether this Method had had any Influence on them, or if the laſt Prorogation had any way cool'd them. But though the Money which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired was to ſtrengthen my Fleet for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Nation, which I concluded that they would the more eaſily grant, becauſe in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98018:114"/> the former Seſſion they complain'd that the French were grown ſtronger than us at Sea; yet ſtill I meet with a Repulſe; and inſtead of Money am anſwered with Complaints and Libels againſt my Adminiſtration. By with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of Money they make me unable to give Rewards; and now they are about de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving me of the Power of inflicting Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: By their Bill of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> they would deliver Criminals from the Irkſomneſs of long Impriſonments at home, and yet will not agree that they ſhould be ſent Priſoners abroad. They are, moreover, ſo ſtubborn, as to deny me Money for ſupport of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and yet will not ſuffer me to raiſe any without their Conſent. Now their Fears of Popery and Slavery come upon them afreſh, which with redoubled Clamours they ſend abroad into the Country, to inſpire the Mob with their own Sentiments, and fill the Nation with endleſs Jealouſies. Hence come their Bills for diſabling Papiſts from ſitting in either Houſe, by which they would rob me of the Aſſiſtance of my beſt Friends. Nor are they content to ſtay there, but they are alſo for having them ſpeedily convicted and puniſh'd, according to their ſanguinary Laws, which in my time ſhall never be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor do their Deſigns reſt here; but as they will not allow me an Army at home,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98018:115"/> they are now for my calling back ſuch as I have abroad, being afraid that they ſhould learn too much of the French Methods of an undiſputed Submiſſion to the Dictates of their Prince. All thoſe diſloyal Practices are fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by Diſſenters and others, who are of Antimonarchical Principles, for which in time I hope for a Revenge; and at preſent am reſolved to give them a Diverſion, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the Quarrel betwixt them and the Lords; and while they are hot in the Conteſt about their own Principles, they will remit their Violence againſt the Papiſts, and forget the Kindneſs which they intended to Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for I have always obſerved this in their Temper, that when they were kind to the one, they were ſevere to the other; and when any Man is diſguſted with that which they call Tyranny in the State, and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with it in the Church, they ſtrait have an Inclination to favour the Phanaticks and Republicans. How could it have happened elſe that the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a Sacrifice to the Reſentments of the Faction, ſhould now make Harangues for an Indulgence to Diſſenters? So that I plainly perceive that all the Enemies to the Glory of my Crown, do neſtle themſelves amongſt that rebellious Herd. Yet herein at leaſt I ſhall reap an Advantage, that the Church will

               <p>HOW unhappy is it for a Monarch to be tied up to the Humours of his People? and thus it muſt be ſo long as Parliaments have any ſhare in the Government, and till the Prince be made Abſolute by the Power of the Sword. I thought to have rendred my Parliaments inſignificant, and altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the Ends for which they are choſe; and by continuing this Parliament ſo long, had well nigh effected my Deſign, having brib'd moſt of them to change their Intereſt, and taken ſuch Methods as to make not a few of them change their Religion; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of acting according to their Original Commiſſion from the Country, they were
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98018:116"/> wholly led by the Dictates of the Court: but now an evil Spirit of Contention having ſeiz'd upon the Lords, they begin to controul me, as <hi>Conſiliarii nati;</hi> and thoſe whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it is to keep the Government ſteady, and therefore move to have this Parliament diſſolv'd, becauſe they can no more be called the Repreſentatives of the Country, ſeeing they have their Dependance wholly upon the Court, and don't vote according to the Mind of thoſe that choſe them: So that they are in the ſame Deſign with my ſelf to ſwallow up the Peoples Liberties, provided they may have ſome Court-Preferments. The Lords do alſo inſiſt upon the frequent Calling of new Parliaments, which they alledg from the Records to have been their ancient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and plead the Preſcriptions of many hundreds of Years. What pity! that all thoſe Monuments of Rebellion ſhould not have periſh'd in the great Conflagration, that they might never have riſen up in Judgment againſt me; but ſeeing they are extant, and ſo violently urg'd, I'll do the beſt I can to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their Force. I can inſinuate to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that theſe Proceedings of the Lords are not the Effect of any Zeal for the People, but merely a Deſire of Revenge upon the Lower Houſe, for their late controverting of their Privileges; and an Averſion that any
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98018:116"/> Commoner, by his Service to the Crown, ſhould merit an Advancement to a Dignity equal with their own: By theſe and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arguments as I can ſuggeſt, I doubt not to have the preſent Houſe of Commons on my ſide. And ſuppoſe it true, that they are not the real Repreſentatives of the Nation, as having forfeited that Title, by going con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Peoples Intereſt and Inſtructions; yet the very Name of their Concurrence adds Credit to my Conduct: and I doubt not but abundance of the Members who have found the Sweets of the Privilege of the Houſe, which protects them from their Creditors, and many times confirms their Titles to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates by Preſcription, becauſe while they are Parliament-men they are ſecured in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; I ſay I have no reaſon to doubt but ſuch Men will be againſt a Diſſolution. It was a wiſe and commendable Practice in my Predeceſſor <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIIIth,</hi> to make Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments long-liv'd, for by that means he had the Opportunity of making them for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and left a happy Precedent for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. Let the Murmurers grumble as much as they pleaſe, and object the Cuſtom of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliaments thrice a Year before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and the Act of <hi>Edward</hi> III. that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments ſhould be holden once a Year, or oftner, I am not tied to thoſe antiquated
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98018:117"/> Rules: If thoſe Kings did not know the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their own Prerogative, I am not therefore obliged to allow any Intrenchments on mine. But ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIIIth</hi> could protract the Duration of a Parliament beyond its former Length, and the Cuſtoms of his Predeceſſors, I may certainly be allowed to exceed the Examples of my Predeceſſors ſince his time, eſpecially having the Clergy on my ſide, who have preach'd up the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive higher than ever it was in former times, and will defend my Practice by the Authority of their Gods. But I am not to be ſo eaſily drawn from what's my Intereſt by the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations or Addreſſes of ſome factious Lords; for it's my Wiſdom to foment the Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding betwixt them and the Commons as much as I can: and if I could but once bring them to have a mutual Diſtruſt of one another, and poſſeſs the Commons with an ill Opinion of the Arrogance of the Lords, and their incroaching too much upon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of the Members, who knows but it might procure ſuch a Surrender to me as that which was lately made to the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> by his People, who could not bear with the Contempt ſhewed to them by their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and therefore did all of a ſudden devolve the whole Power upon the King, and render him Abſolute? Or if no ſuch thing ſhould
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98018:117"/> happen, yet by making the Houſe for my purpoſe I can with the more Eaſe attain my Deſires; and if once the Commons were brought to comply, the Popiſh Lords, Court-Lords and Biſhops, will eaſily caſt the Vote in the Upper Houſe. But let things go as they will, I am ſure of this one infallible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; I can poſſeſs the Clergy, by means of the Biſhops, that if this Parliament be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, the Mitre and Crown are both in danger; and then all thoſe who are Enemies to my Deſigns ſhall be threatned with Hell and Damnation, as oppoſing themſelves to God's Ordinance, to which they ought to be ſubject for Conſcience-ſake. And on the other hand, I am very ſure that thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Houſe of Commons, who have ſpent ſome hundreds and thouſands of Pounds for the Advantages which they had a Proſpect of enjoying by being Parliament-men, will never ſubmit willingly to a Diſſolution, nor be content to put themſelves to the hazard of a new Choice: And I am ſure of my Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for their Uſefulneſs to themſelves and me both ceaſes with their not being Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men; for as in that caſe they cannot do me any Service, ſo neither can they tell where to have Subſiſtence.</p>
               <p>I have had the good Fortune to put a Check upon thoſe factious Lords, and to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98018:118"/> throw out their Addreſs by the Majority of Votes, in which the Biſhops were all on my ſide, ſo happily are the Intereſts of the Church and Crown united. Hence I find the Advantage of diſſembling a Zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though in my Heart I believe the whole to be a Cheat; for my profeſſing my ſelf to be the grand Patron of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſets all the Clergy at work for me; and they having the Conduct of the Peoples Conſciences, are uſeful Tools for any Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
               <p>The Country Lords have proteſted againſt the Votes for rejecting the Addreſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted their Reaſons in the Journals of the Houſe, but it ſignifies nothing, ſeeing they have loſt their Cauſe; however it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as an Indictment againſt them: and now that I have their Names as my Enemies on record, I ſhall take care on occaſion to treat them as ſuch, and make them odious to the Country, by charging all the Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Heats in Parliament, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Obſtruction of whatever might have been advantagious to the Publick, upon them.</p>

               <p>HAving been hitherto unſucceſsful in my Attempts of following French Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, raiſing a Standing Army, bribing Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men, and contriving Oaths to ſwear the People into Arbitrary Government, I muſt try ſome new Methods, and endeavour to carry on my Deſigns by Shadow of Law: for which end it is neceſſary that I make a Reform amongſt my Judges, and inſtead of granting their Commiſſion <hi>ad vitam aut ad culpam,</hi> will make them hold them by a new Tenure of <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> by which they will be bound to their good Behaviour, and not dare to diſoblige me, but give out my Will as the Oracles of the Law, and then I can effect that by a Shadow of Juſtice which is not ſo ſafe to attempt by Force: and when all Cauſes come to be decided by Favour in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98018:119"/> Court, I ſhall deſpoil my Enemies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich my Friends, which is the ſureſt way to increaſe them; for I have ſufficient Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Inconvenience of Judges who keep ſtrictly to the Rules of the Law, and therefore ſhall take care now that Judg <hi>Hales</hi> is dead, that none of Puritanical Education and Principles ſhall henceforth fill his Chair: And thus when I can by Forms of Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of my Subjects Lives and Eſtates, I may perhaps find my Judges as uſeful as a Standing Army, and worm my ſelf by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees into Arbitrary Government, by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods leſs odious, and not ſo perceptible.</p>
               <p>I do alſo find it neceſſary in order to the taking off of that general Diſguſt which the People of this Kingdom have imbib'd againſt Popery, that ſome Authors be incourag'd to write ſmoothly on that Subject, and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Difference betwixt the Court and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the latter is not charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the Miſcarriages of the former; and that an Union amongſt Chriſtians is highly deſireable. And in the ſame manner I muſt take care to reconcile the Minds of my Subjects to the Prerogative, and brand thoſe who oppoſe it as Men of ill Deſigns and Principles.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing the Non-compliance of my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with the Meaſures which I take, may
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98018:119"/> probably iſſue in a Rebellion, it will be my Wiſdom to ſecure a Place of Retreat, to take care before-hand, that I may be made wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and order it ſo as the French King may have Effects of my own wherewith to maintain me if the worſt ſhould happen, and be in a Condition to reſtore me, in caſe I ſhould be expell'd; for I am reſolv'd to take Warning by my Father's Fate, and either to ſtoop to invincible Neceſſity, or provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſevereſt Lot which may befal me, and not to quarrel with my Subjects without good aſſurance of Foreign Alliance, and while they are rich, and have Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition: Therefore I ſhall order it ſo that the French King may interrupt their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce by his Privateers, and ſeize their Ships, Men and Goods, which will humble them: And in the mean time when they addreſs to me for Relief, I can excuſe my being unable to defend them, ſeeing they are ſo backward in giving me Money to rig out my Fleet: and that I muſt not upon the Miſcarriage of Privateers break the Friendſhip betwixt the two Nations, conſidering the great abundance of Male-contents which are at home, and the Improbability of my receiving any Aſſiſtance from abroad, now that the Parliament by their frequent Clamours of the Deſigns of the Court to introduce Popery and Slavery, had
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98018:120"/> rendred me ſuſpicious to Foreign Proteſtants. However, that they may not ſuſpect my Concurrence with the French in this Affair, they ſhall now and then have Orders for my Reſident at the French Court to demand Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; but if they have it, it ſhall coſt them ſo dear, as to make them quickly grow weary of that Method. This indeed may ſeem unnatural for a Soveraign to concur with a Foreign Prince to rob his own Subjects, but in my Heart I think they deſerve no better; their Prieſts have from the Mouth of their Divine Oracles preach'd up the Prerogative, and Greatneſs of my Power, that my People were created for me, and not I for them; that their Lives and Fortunes are at my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and yet they allow me no Power in either; ſo that it's but reaſonable they ſhould ſmart for their damn'd Hypocriſy; and it's juſt, ſeeing they will not allow me to take it with my own Hand, that I take it from them by the Hand of another. Their Riches and Fulneſs of Bread gives them occaſion to be idle, and leiſure to concert their Meaſures of Rebellion; to prevent which Poverty is the ſureſt Method: And in the mean time the French King allows me to go Sharers with him in the Profit, which my Enemies call by the ignominious Name of a Penſion. But ſeeing my Subjects and their Fortunes are my
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98018:120"/> Property, what reaſon have I to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to any how I treat them. And ſeeing I am not to own that I have any legitimate Heirs of my own Body to ſucceed me, why ſhould I not make my Life as pleaſant as I can; which being impoſſible without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it's but reaſon that I ſhould uſe my own Methods to come by it, ſeeing my Subjects are backward to grant me what I need.</p>
               <p>But I have yet a ſtronger Reaſon for this kind of Procedure, the Catholicks having taught me that it is lawful to kill, by neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſequence it muſt be much more lawful to impoveriſh my Heretical Subjects, and put them out of a Condition to withſtand the Reintroduction of that Religion which they pretend will merit a Crown in Heaven: And if there be any ſuch Place or Reward, I know no other way how I can deſerve it; for rather than take ſuch Methods to obtain it, as Proteſtants think needful, I had better want it. Let thoſe who have a mind to pull out their right Eyes, and cut off their right Hands, do ſo if they pleaſe, I'll keep mine as long as I can. And ſeeing, according to the Catholicks, the <hi>Opus operatum</hi> is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to carry me to Heaven, I need not be ſo ſcrupulous nor nice about the way; it being reaſonable that Kings ſhould be allow'd a broader Path than others: And that ſeeing
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98018:121"/> we are God's Vice-gerents on Earth, he ſhould afford us a more commodious Paſſage than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to Heaven. And that I may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſerve it according to their Doctrine, I ſhall not only take care to furniſh <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. the great Champion of the Catholick Church, with an Opportunity to enrich himſelf with the Treaſures of my Heretical Subjects, but alſo ſupply him with Arms and Ammunition from my own Magazines, as I have already taught him the way of building Men of War, and improving his Naval Strength, that if I be not able to effectuate the great Deſign my ſelf, he or his Succeſſors may do it when I am dead; for I find that it will never be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable by any Engliſh King without very powerful Aſſiſtance from abroad. I know that my Meaſures are condemned, my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns ſuſpected, and Liſts of the Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Arms which I have ſent to <hi>France,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of ſending them to <hi>Jerſey,</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about: But I have this Advantage, that my Enemies are not united; and they who are moſt zealous to oppoſe me, rendred ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently odious to the Church and their Party, who being countenanc'd by my Authority, are much the ſtrongeſt, or at leaſt able enough to keep the reſt under Hatches: And while they contend againſt each other, I obtain the Victory over both. I have, however, not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98018:121"/> only ſecured my ſelf a Place of Retreat and Royal Maintenance, in caſe of my being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by my Subjects, ſhould there happen a Rupture, but I have alſo weakned the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines of the Nation, and provided ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Arms and Ammunition for my ſelf to equip my French Auxiliaries, and aſſert my Right, or at leaſt have furniſh'd the French Catholicks with Weapons againſt my Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Subjects at their own Expence. And if the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-men ſhould murmur againſt this Procedure, it's but a ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree above what was done by my Father, whom they have canoniz'd for a Saint and a Martyr; it being well enough known that he aſſiſted the French King with his Men of War againſt his Hugonot-Subjects of <hi>Rochel;</hi> which, conſidering the Claim that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> is much the ſame with what I have now done: So that they cannot condemn me without condemning him; nor condemn him without condemning themſelves.</p>

LVIII.</hi> On the Meeting of the Parliament after the long Prorogation, <hi>Febr. 1676.</hi> His Majeſty's Demand of Money, recommending a good Correſpondence to the two Houſes. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether the Parliament was not diſſolv'd by that unprecedented Prorogation: Sending ſome Lords to the Tower for inſiſting on it. The granting of Money by the Commons.</head>
               <p>THE Greatneſs of my Expence requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring proportionable Supplies, and my Returns from <hi>France</hi> not being ſufficient, I muſt once more adventure on a Seſſion of Parliament, not doubting but my Penſioners will for their own Intereſt gratify my Deſires. I know that this long Prorogation is beyond all Precedent; but I think that I have the beſt Authority to make one of any Body, and I am furniſh'd already with a very plauſible Pretence, that ſuch a long Receſs was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely needful to allay ſo great a Heat as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened betwixt the Houſes laſt Seſſions. But however, that the Honour of the Nation ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſtake, I found it neceſſary to call them together for a Supply to enable me to rig out my Navy, on which ſo much of our Strength
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98018:122"/> and Reputation depends. The March of my Brother the French King, with his Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Flanders,</hi> I know will alarm and make them apprehenſive of their own Danger, which will probably induce them to part with Money for their own Defence.</p>
               <p>But I perceive that my Difficulties are not quite over, for now both Houſes begin to queſtion my laſt Prorogation, and think that it was really a Diſſolution; yet the Commons I find the moſt tractable of the two, becauſe there my Penſioners are moſt numerous; ſo that they have paſs'd it over, and fall to their Buſineſs: but the factious Lords I find ſtill more obſtinate and daring; inſomuch that they offer to maintain, that the laſt Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was illegal, and contrary to all the Laws of Parliament, even before the Judges; and are ſo confident, that they demand to have their Opinion in it: but though I can rely upon their Determination, yet I don't think fit to gratify the oppoſite Faction ſo far, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing I am ſure of the Majority in any Queſtion, by the Influence of the Court-Lords and Biſhops; and therefore their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence in falling foul upon my Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a thing without Precedent, ſhall be puniſh'd by an Impriſonment in the Tower, of the ſame Nature, which I ſhall order ſo, that it ſhall appear to be the Act of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Peers,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:98018:123"/> and not mine. And thus the Ring-leaders of the Faction, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Earls of <hi>Salisbury, Shaftsbury,</hi> and Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> ſhall have time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Queſtion in their Confinement; and by this Means others will be deterred from the like Boldneſs; and the Freedom of Debate, which hath been hitherto claim'd and allow'd in Parliament, be viſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring'd, of which there is an abſolute and very great Neceſſity; and now more than ever, when ſome of the Members have had the Impudence to upbraid the Houſe to their Face, that a great part of them are Out-laws, abundance Papiſts, and no ſmall number Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners: And though I cannot but commend the Prudence of my Friends in the Houſe, in not ſending the Authors of ſuch ſcandalous Reflections to the Tower, becauſe they know them to be true; yet ſuch things muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented if poſſible, otherwiſe I and my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall fall into Contempt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, my Penſioners were rather willing to bear this Affront, than to do any thing that might make their Diſſolution or Prorogation neceſſary; and that they may ſhow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of my Allowance, have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me Money, and that very frankly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Appropriating Clauſe: So that I am at liberty to ſpend it how I pleaſe. And as
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98018:123"/> they have been generous in their Grant, they have been no leſs as to the Terms, having quitted all their other Pretenſions for an <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus</hi> Act. And thus I find the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of having thoſe who depend upon me choſen for Parliament-men, though I be at the Expence of their Election my ſelf: For what Privy-Counſellor is there that will not juſtify the moſt Arbitrary Proceedings of the Council-Table in the Houſe, rather than loſe his Place in Council? and repreſent all the Proceedings of State to the Advantage of the Crown, rather than loſe his Prince's Favour? What Lawyer is there that will not put a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Conſtruction upon the Sentence of the Judges, rather than be ſubjected to the Frowns of the Bench, or excluded all Hopes of mounting it himſelf? What Captain of the Fleet or Navy but will be for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a Standing Force, as knowing that he cannot otherwiſe have a ſtanding Pay? Or will he not rather defend the Procedure of his ſuperiour Officers, than hazard the loſing of his Commiſſion? And will he not be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to declare his Abhorrence of that traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Poſition of taking up Arms againſt the King, or any commiſſionated by him? What Commiſſioner of the Cuſtoms or Exciſe is there that will not rather give the Court a Vote than loſe his Commiſſion? Or which of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98018:124"/> my Domeſticks will be ſo bold as to vote againſt me in Parliament? And therefore I am reſolved never to part with my Privilege of having thoſe who depend upon me choſen for Parliament-men, that being the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and leaſt obnoxious Method that can be taken to render my ſelf Abſolute; for they are at the ſame time the Repreſentatives of the Country, and my Penſioners and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: and ſo long as they have vendible Souls, and have moſt from me, I need not doubt of their being on my ſide: and when others who are hungry perceive their Fellows to be not only treated with Money, but alſo at good Tables on the Charge of the Court, it will make them willing to take the ſame Meaſures, that they may enjoy the ſame Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. And in the next place I ſhall take care to have the Sheriffs modell'd to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and then they will determine the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Elections as I would have them: And if the injured Fanatick or Republican complain of the Sheriff, yet the Majority of the Judges can eaſily vacate his Fine. By this Means thoſe of my Party will always know their own Strength in the Houſe; ſo that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments made upon the People will be judg'd the Affection of the Parliament-men to the Crown, and not be charg'd on my aſpiring Humour or Ambition. And I know
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98018:124"/> that a Parliament of ſuch a Conſtitution will rather do any thing than hazard my Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and not dare to impeach any Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know their own Guilt: and ſo thoſe who are my Tools for promoting the Catholick Religion and Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall paſs unpuniſhed. But that the Nation may not perceive my Intrigue, and thereupon grow tumultuous, the Commons ſhall have leave now and then to talk of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and alſo to name thoſe who are the Inſtruments of them; but if they exceed their Bounds, they ſhall be kick'd from one Adjournment to another, chaſtiſed by Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and Abatements of their Penſions, and kept in obedience by Threatnings of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. I have already ſome Experience of the good Effects of theſe Methods, for now they have voted me double that Sum for building of Ships that they thought ſufficient laſt Seſſions, and continued the double Exciſe upon Beer and Ale; and have taken care to make the Nation have a good Opinion of their being ſtill a legal Parliament, when ſo great a Number of the Gentry of the Nation are appointed Collectors of the Money which they have given.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BY committing the factious Lords to the Tower, my Deſigns run on more ſmoothly in the Upper Houſe, inſomuch that thoſe Bills paſs'd them without any Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but they have not had the ſame Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongſt the Commons, who have thrown out the firſt after once reading, and the ſecond in the ſame manner, with a Note of Diſgrace, as being contradictory to its own Title. I perceive that the Commons, though they don't love their Religion for Religion ſake, yet they have no mind to part with it becauſe of their Intereſt; for if Popery were introduced, Arbitrary Government would find its way more eaſy, and then they could neither be aſſur'd of their Places nor Penſions, ſo that I muſt contrive ſome new Method. But were I as happy in the Church-of-<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>-Laity as I am in their Clergy, there would be no need of ſuch Precaution; which
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98018:125"/> makes me ſmile at the Apology of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who are ſo very careful about the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of their Biſhops, tho they don't look upon their Concurrence with thoſe Bills to be any way hurtful to their Reputation. By this Method they diminiſh the Authority of their Church, and exalt their own Wiſdom above that of their ſpiritual Fathers, whom they believe to be appointed by Divine Right to overſee and take care of the Affairs of the Church. Nor can the Weakneſs of their Apology paſs without a Remark, that they ſhould think it worth while to excuſe them, as not being the Contrivers and Promoters; and yet own that they did not oppoſe thoſe Bills; nay, they plainly confeſs that ſome of the Biſhops were of the Cabal that hatch'd them. Certainly it can never be ſafe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt one's ſelf in that Church which owns that her Guides are blind, or to commit one's Conſcience to the Direction of ſuch as don't know how to direct their own. But if the Commons had hit upon the true Reaſon of the Concurrence of their Biſhops, they would find it to have been becauſe the Mitres and Ceremonies, which is all that they mean by their Church, would be ſufficiently ſecur'd; though Popery were eſtabliſhed; and they being in preſent Poſſeſſion, might merit a Continuance by promoting the Catholick
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98018:126"/> Intereſt under-hand. Nor can I believe that the Commons don't perceive this, ſeeing the Biſhops advance ſuch Clergy-men daily who incline mightily to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Doctrine of Juſtification, which <hi>Luther</hi> their great Patron own'd to be <hi>Articulus ſtantis &amp; cadentis Eccleſiae;</hi> and yet they won't ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of one Man to enjoy a Benefice, who does not accept of Epiſcopal Ordination, and conforms to the Ceremonies, whence it's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and apparent that by theſe they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Church. And the Commons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though they ſeem now to differ a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from the Biſhops, yet make uſe of this Diſtinction to keep all but thoſe of their own Communion out of any Publick Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And I am apt to think, that could they but ſecure their own Intereſt in a Change, as well as the Biſhops can do theirs, they would never make ſo much to do in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Popery, which I am convinc'd by my own Experience is a Religion beſt ſuted of any to ſuch as would live in thoſe Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Preciſians call carnal Delights; and that the greateſt part of the Members are ſuch, I have reaſon to know, for I am ſure it has and does daily coſt me Money. And hence I conclude that it does not proceed from any Religious Principle that the preſent Houſe of Commons do ſeem
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98018:126"/> more oppoſite to have a Popiſh King than the Biſhops.</p>

               <p>MY Subjects are now upon another Scent; and from the Affairs of their Religion and Property at home, are come to conſider of the State of Affairs abroad. I could be very glad that they ſhould have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born any ſuch Motion, but ſhall take proper Methods to render it ineffectual. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks and Commonwealth's-men do ſtill fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Jealouſies; and having put Checks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Deſigns at home, they are now for curbing my Allies beyond Sea, and putting a ſtop to the French Conqueſts. The <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> being look'd upon as the natural Barrier
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98018:127"/> of <hi>England,</hi> I muſt not poſitively refuſe to aſſiſt them, but ſhall form ſuch plauſible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts as will excuſe my Delay. And in the mean time, though I cannot go on with my part of the Deſign, the French King may go on with his. However, I have promiſed them to uſe all Means in my Power for the Safety of my Kingdoms; but that does not ſatisfy, and therefore they preſented me with another Addreſs, wherein they not only peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as becomes Subjects, but boldly direct, as if they were Maſters; by which they do manifeſtly entrench upon my Power of making Peace and War. By proffering to aſſiſt me to the uttermoſt againſt <hi>France,</hi> no doubt they think they have acquitted themſelves bravely, though it is no more than what in Duty they are bound to do, let me be engaged in what War I pleaſe. But ſeeing they preſs ſo much for my making of Alliances with the Dutch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to make an actual War with <hi>France,</hi> I muſt give my Friends Inſtructions to argue againſt it in the Houſe, from the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which may attend it; as the ſeizing of our Ships and Effects by the French, which will afford them a Million to carry on the War; that they will ruine our Plantations abroad, diſturb our Trade by their Capers; that they are better provided both of Ships
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98018:127"/> and Ammunition than we; that if we ſhould engage in a War with the Dutch, they would ſlip the Coller by a ſeparate Peace; and that it's not poſſible to make any firm Alliance with thoſe of ſuch different Principles and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as the Emperor and Princes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> But I find that the other Party are not ſo eaſy to be put off: They pretend not to preſs me to make War, but to make Leagues to prevent War; that now is the critical Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prevent the growing Greatneſs of <hi>France;</hi> that the ſame Inconveniences will happen as to our Trade, if the War be not begun till three or four Years hence; that we may as well defend our Plantations and Sea-Trade as the Dutch can do theirs; that it's the Effect of the Male-adminiſtration of this Reign, that the French are ſtronger by Sea than we; that the Dutch and German Princes will be as firm in their League with us, as they are in that with one another; and that the Dutch would aſſiſt us in ſuch things for our Fleet as we were defective in; that the want of a Trade with <hi>France</hi> would rather be an Advantage than otherwiſe to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe their imported Goods, which we could live without, do exceed what we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to their Country a Million <hi>per annum;</hi> and that my ſelling of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and making War on the Dutch in 1665. hath contributed
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98018:128"/> to their over-grown Greatneſs; and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuch ſeditious Reflections. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I teſtify my Contempt of them by a profound Silence, until I find a convenient time; and mean while, by the Intereſt of my Penſioners and Servants in the Houſe, I have got ſome Money to further my Deſigns, according to my Demand.</p>
               <p>My Fate is chequered with Variety of Fortune: The Succeſs of the French againſt the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> where they have taken ſome Towns, and defeated the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> will embolden me to carry it with the more Authority againſt my refractory Subjects, and give a plauſible Pretence for demanding more Money, elſe I cannot be in a condition to defend them againſt ſuch a powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And whereas they may alledg that the 200000 <hi>l.</hi> which they have lately given, is enough to ſupply my preſent Occaſions until ſuch time as they meet again, I can anſwer, that that Sum is otherwiſe applied: ſo that the Country ſhall not be able to ſee into the true Reaſon of their Adjournment at this Juncture, but will probably be induced to believe that it is becauſe of their having deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me Money; and during their Receſs I ſhall have leiſure to entertain the ſpendid Embaſſy which is coming hither from my Brother of <hi>France,</hi> and concert ſuch Meaſures
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98018:128"/> as may either render all ſuch factious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans, as Parliaments, wholly uſeleſs, or at leaſt order it ſo as I ſhall not be ſo much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their capricious Humours: but by this ſeeming Difference betwixt them and me, the Nation will be brought to have a good Opinion of this preſent Houſe of Commons, who will thereby have the better Opportunity to gratify me, and deſerve their Penſions; and therefore I made a Demand of 600000 <hi>l.</hi> which I knew they could not grant, that they might have an occaſion of refuſing it, and at the ſame time afford me one of adjourning them with a plauſible Pretext.</p>

               <p>HAving adjourned the Parliament, I muſt now make ready to meet the French Embaſſy; and <hi>London</hi> being a Place where there are too many Spies upon my Actions, I deſign to chooſe <hi>New-market</hi> as the fitter
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98018:129"/> Place; there we may confer with more Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Security, and adjuſt Matters better to our Mind. I know that my mutinous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will load this Conference with many aggravating Reflections; but if I can carry my Point, I ſhall not value that. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>France</hi> I know will plead for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of my Subjects in his Service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not a little contributed to the Glory of his Arms: and he will alſo inſiſt on the Abolition of all Claims on the account of the Prizes which his Subjects have made of mine, and other things of that Nature, which ſhall be granted according as I find him liberal in his Supplies of Money. Thoſe Demands, eſpecially the latter, are fit to be made, that the private Agreement betwixt him and my ſelf may be conceal'd: and for the other, it muſt alſo be regulated by my own Intereſt, and that of the Deſign which we carry on in conjunction; for by a firm U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betwixt us, we ſhall add Strength to our common Endeavours, and may in time bring things to a happy Concluſion: But ſeeing I have no Reaſon to deſpair of effecting my part by a Form of Law, conſidering what Party I have in both Houſes, I will prepare to entertain the next Seſſion of Parliament, and contrive Arguments to make them libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of their Fellow-Subjects Purſes, which
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98018:129"/> will be the moſt effectual Method that I can think of to accelerate my Deſigns.</p>
               <p>The Parliament being now met, I have renew'd my Demands of Money, becauſe they alledg that it was not according to the Methods and Rules of Parliament for them to grant me any more at the Cloſe of the laſt Seſſions, when the Houſe was ſo thin: but that Objection being vacated by their meeting now in a full Body, it might have been thought that they ſhould have fallen upon the Money of Courſe; but inſtead of that they inſiſt again upon an Alliance with <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as the only mean of withſtanding the French: By which I perceive that the Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Jealouſies gain ground; they are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to have me declare War my ſelf, but they would yoke me with the Dutch, who will be ſure to inſpect my Conduct ſeverely, and then I muſt act againſt <hi>France</hi> in good earneſt. I find that all the Objections that I can make, as that ſuch a League would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm the French, if imparted before made; and that ſuch things are of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and require time to be concerted, are eaſily ſeen through; and the Commons having taken Umbrage from the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry French Embaſſy, alledg that my Brother of <hi>France</hi> and I underſtand one another's Minds: Wherefore I find it neceſſary to ſend
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98018:130"/> for the Houſe, and in a publick Speech aſſure them, on my Royal Word, that my calling them together was not only a Deſign to get Money, as ſome do inſinuate; and tell them poſitively, that I will neither hazard my own Safety nor theirs, by declaring againſt <hi>France,</hi> or leaguing with the Dutch, till they ſupply me with Money to act and ſpeak as I ſhould; and that therefore it will be their Fault and not mine, if their Security be not provided for. By this means I ſhall amuſe the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and prevent the general Diſguſt of the Nation. And if I can but preſerve my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with the People, I ſhall deſpiſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of particular Men; for herein I think <hi>Saul</hi> acted truly like a Monarch, that though <hi>Samuel</hi> had denounced the Anger of God againſt him for diſobeying his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he was not in the leaſt ſolicitous about that, but pray'd that the Prophet would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him before the People: he took care of his Concerns for this Life, let it fare with him as it would for what was to come. But to what I ſay my ſelf, my Friends ſhall have Inſtructions to add, the Right of making Peace and War is in me alone; that if they with-hold Money, I will neither declare War, nor make Leagues; that I have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted my own Treaſury in rigging out 44 Ships of War to preſerve their Trade, and

Thoſe Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be readily imbib'd, and diligently improv'd by the Courtiers and Clergy, and then let my Enemies inſiſt as much as they pleaſe upon the Neceſſity of ſhutting the Door towards <hi>France,</hi> elſe our Treaſure and Trade will creep out, and their Religion and Tyranny creep in: I am ſure to have the Advantage of them when my Dictates ſhall be delivered from the Pulpits once <hi>per</hi> Week, as the Oracles of Heaven. And thus I ſhall make void all their Efforts for leſſening the Power of <hi>France,</hi> which I perceive they dread, as carrying with it the Bane of their Hereſy and Republican Principles; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's as neceſſary for my Deſign, that the Power of the French King be kept up, as it is neceſſary for theirs that it ſhould be brought low.</p>
               <p>I am unhappy, that notwithſtanding of all my Penſions an Addreſs for an Alliance with the States, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be carried in the Houſe, and have but two Negatives againſt it, eſpecially conſidering that they alledg it to be unprecedented to grant any Money till the Wars and Alliances for which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded be ſignified in Parliament; which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98018:131"/> plainly implies their Diſtruſt of me, that though I ſhould have the Money, yet I would not anſwer their Addreſs; which is ſo miſchievouſly compoſed, and ſo ſtrongly back'd with popular Reaſons, that it ſeems to be calculated for poſſeſſing the Subjects that I would never ſuffer the French King to increaſe his Strength ſo much, to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Hazard of my Kingdoms, if I were not engaged in the ſame Deſign with him. I do alſo perceive that the Allegations of my Friends in the Houſe, of their intrenching upon my Prerogative, by directing me with whom to make Alliances, is nothing regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but their Practice defended by former Precedents of Parliaments, who have not only adviſed to Alliances, but alſo confirm'd them, as in the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> III. <hi>Richard</hi> II. and <hi>Henry</hi> V. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though my Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were more ſerviceable in voting againſt the Manner and Words of the Addreſs, than formerly that there ſhould be one, yet they are worſted by a conſiderable Majority; ſo unhappy is it for a King to depend upon the Humour of his Subjects, which is as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as the Waves of the Sea, and liable to the Toſſings of every Wind; for however complaiſant they have formerly been, yet now they are all on a fire again about Popery and <hi>France:</hi> So that I find my ſelf under a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98018:131"/> Neceſſity of cooling them by an Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and checking them by a ſevere Speech for intrenching on my Prerogative of making Peace and War, in ſuch an unprecedented manner, while King and Parliament were not at mutual Enmity. By which they would ſeem to claim a Privilege not only of direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me what Alliances to make, but alſo to inſinuate, that it were not in my Power to make any without their leave; ſo that I ſhall be look'd on by Foreigners as a King merely in Title. I ſhall alſo take care that their Proceedings ſhall not dare to appear in print. Whereas my Speech ſhall publickly proclaim their Diſloyalty; and the Speaker being made to my purpoſe, I ſhall hinder the Commons from debating the Adjournment, or diving into the Intrigues of the Court; for if ever they begin to meddle in it, he ſhall have Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to quit the Chair; by which the Houſe muſt break up of Courſe: and then the French ſhall have liberty to purſue their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts without Interruption by the Clamours of my Heretical Parliament; who, as alſo thoſe that they repreſent, ſhall be duly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis'd in time convenient.</p>

               <p>THe ſafeſt and moſt ſecure way of rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ones ſelf of an Enemy, is to ſmite them under the fifth Rib, while they imbrace them on pretence of Kindneſs. And as <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>IXth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> contriv'd the Deſtruction of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants under the Covert of a Marriage with their Chief the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> I may carry on the like Deſign by matching my Niece with the Prince of <hi>Orange. Saul</hi> gave his Daughter <hi>Michal</hi> to <hi>David</hi> to be a Snare to him: Nor is it out of any Kindneſs to my Nephew the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that I do now marry him upon my Niece. He hath not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto behaved himſelf ſo like a dutiful Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, as to deſerve ſuch a Favour, having not only been the chief Support of the War againſt the French, but incouraged the Dutch boldly in their Wars againſt my ſelf. But it
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98018:132"/> may be this Match may take him off, or at leaſt will afford me an Opportunity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting it with more Vigour and Frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than hitherto. However, let the Succeſs as to that be what it will, this Advantage I am ſure of reaping from it, that my Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects will be thereby pleaſed; and their Jealouſies, as to my Deſign of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Popery and Arbitrary Government, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo that being the leſs ſuſpected, I ſhall go on with the more Succeſs, and forward my Purpoſe. My Parliament, I perceive, are pleas'd with this Alliance, and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered me an Addreſs of Thanks; yet their Fears and Jealouſies are not ſo much quieted, as to leave me at freedom from their Solicitations, but ſtill they inſiſt on my not admitting any Treaty of Peace, by which the French may be left in poſſeſſion of any thing that they have taken ſince the Pyrenaean Treaty; and confine their Promiſes of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to my making a War with <hi>France.</hi> How happy are unlimited Monarchs, whoſe Will is their Law, and whom their Subjects dare not controul? but my Stars have not yet bleſſed me with any ſuch Influences. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine how this phanatical diſcontented Humour hath got ſo much the Aſcendant of this, which was once a Loyal Parliament; or that my Penſioners and Friends ſhould
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98018:133"/> come ſo far ſhort of their wonted Devoirs: Perhaps the late Checks which they have met with by my Speech and Adjournments, have given them ſome Umbrage to ſuſpect that they are not long-liv'd; and therefore they would now endeavour to recover their Credit with the Country: They diſcovered before, by the Motions which ſome of my Friends made of impowering me to raiſe what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I pleas'd upon extraordinary Occaſions, that I was grown weary of Parliaments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that my Bounty to them would ceaſe with their Uſefulneſs to me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are taking care to make their Fortunes another way; and ſo run out violently for a War with <hi>France.</hi> I muſt humour them a little to further my own Ends, and pretend to be for ſuch a War, that I may once get their Money, and then I can lay it out which way I pleaſe. I ſhall alſo make an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it another way, by obliging the French King to open his Coffers, on pretence that I muſt otherwiſe comply with my Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And by this Means I ſhall be ſure to have Money one way or other. If the Commons muſt be gratified with a War on <hi>France,</hi> it's but reaſonable that it ſhould be carried on at their Expence, and therefore I will demand no leſs than a Million. I know that my PRetences of Alliances with the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98018:133"/> Dutch, and Agreement to the Prohibition of a Trade with <hi>France,</hi> will be irreſiſtible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to carry my Demand; and thoſe I am reſolv'd to improve to the utmoſt.</p>

               <p>THE Parliament having given Money; it remains for me to improve it: and that they may be induc'd to believe that it
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98018:134"/> ſhall be applied to the Ends for which it was given, an Army ſhall be rais'd, but ſuch as I hope will put me in a Condition, that I ſhall ſtand in no more need of Parliamentary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. The principal Poſts in Church and State are already ſo well fill'd with Perſons ſuted to my Deſigns, that I can ſcarcely have better. And now I muſt take care to model the Army; to have moſt of the Souldiers, if poſſible, compoſed of ſuch Men as are either Catholicks, or but Proteſtants in Name; and the Officers, in like manner, either alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Catholicks, or ſuch who by taking the Teſt to qualify them for their Office, may nevertheleſs advance the Catholick Cauſe: for which Reaſon I am happy in the Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it being ſo framed, that moderate Catholicks may eaſily comply with it. The Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing form'd, my next Care muſt be how to get them paid, for the Money granted by the Parliament will quickly be conſum'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and my neceſſary Pleaſures: and therefore ſeeing the French King and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks preſs me to the furtherance of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Deſigns, it's highly reaſonable that the ſame ſhould be carried on with their own Money. I having done my part in being at the Expence of raiſing an Army, they are obliged to maintain them: and if to the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98018:134"/> 300000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> which the French King is obliged to pay towards it, the Conclave of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> will contribute their Shares, the Work will be done, and I ſhall no more ſtand in need of ſuch tumultuous Divans as Parliaments, who inſtead of granting me Money, which is their only Province, do dive into my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and obſtruct my Meaſures. It will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me obnoxious to Diſcovery and Cenſure, to keep a Correſpondence with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> in my own Perſon, and therefore I think it adviſeable to do it by my Brother, who can better keep the Pope and Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi> to their Promiſe than I can do: and if the Buſineſs ſhould happen to be perceiv'd, he being a Subject can eaſily make his Eſcape, and retire a while till I weather out the Storm.</p>
               <p>That I may prevent as much as in me lies all Impediments of what Nature ſoever, I have alſo taken care to put <hi>Scotland</hi> out of a Condition to oppoſe me, as remembring ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that the Presbyterians of that Nation were the firſt who made head againſt my Father; and therefore I have conſum'd the Subſtance of the richeſt and moſt phanatical part of the Kingdom, by bringing down an Army of Popiſh Highlanders to take Free Quarter upon them; for which the frequent
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98018:135"/> and numerous Meetings of the Presbyterians hath furniſh'd me with a Pretence, I having taken ſuch Methods, that either they ſhould have no Meetings at all for hearing Sermons by their own Miniſters, or be obliged to meet in the Fields, and not in Safety there neither, except they put themſelves in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Defence; and if they do that, I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my Point, and have a fair Opportunity of charging them with Rebellion, and taking my Meaſures againſt them accordingly. I am alſo ſecure as to the meeting with any Obſtruction from <hi>Ireland,</hi> having indulged the Papiſts in that Kingdom ſo far as they have got the Aſcendant, and put ſuch Men in all Places of Power and Truſt as are ſincere and cordial for my Deſigns: ſo that I had no Reaſon to deſpair of bringing things to a good Iſſue, if the Influences of my Stars, which are always malignant, had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my private Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> and rais'd a new Ferment of Jealouſy amongſt the Commons, who upbraid the Court for want of Sincerity; that at the very time when they talk of an actual War, they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into ſecret Treaties with their Enemies. And hence I am importun'd by another ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Addreſs, that I ſhould immediately proclaim and declare War againſt the French King, recal my Ambaſſador from his Court,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98018:135"/> and diſmiſs his from mine. So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the ſevere Check which I gave them by my Speech the laſt time that they preſum'd to give me ſuch Directions, they perſiſt ſtill in the ſame Method. And to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me to my Subjects, in revenge of my having expos'd them formerly in the Gazette for their Diſobedience, they have publickly declar'd that they have a Bill ready to aſſiſt me with Money if once I declare War, which they ſolicite me to undertake, that the French King may be ſo reduced as to be no longer ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to my Subjects. And leſt the People ſhould not take notice of this Addreſs, they have voted another, wherein they preſs, that I may be deſired to enter into an Alliance with the Emperor, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Dutch. <hi>Heu quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi> What Difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a King newly inthron'd or reſtor'd, and one who has reign'd till his People are weary of him? Who would have thought that a Parliament which hath enabled me to trample upon their Brethren the Proteſtant Diſſenters, and puniſh them for their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Practices and Principles, ſhould fall into the ſame Crimes themſelves for which they condemn others? What Difference is there betwixt the Scots Presbyterian Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, and the Addreſſes of this Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Houſe-of-Commons?
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98018:136"/> Could any Fanatick libel my Adminiſtration with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Severity than they have done? and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of their oppoſing the ſame things in my Father which they themſelves do now oppoſe in me. How have they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to load them with Reproaches, and render them odious to all Poſterity, as Enemies to Monarchy? But ſeeing the Caſe is thus, I will purſue my own Meaſures; and inſtead of declaring open War againſt <hi>France,</hi> aſſiſt them with Proviſion and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition under-hand, on pretence of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> &amp;c. And by my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt with the Pope's Nuncio, and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes concerned in the Treaty of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen,</hi> will labour to have them accept of the French King's Propoſals of Peace, and that will put an end to the Importunity of my Parliament for declaring a War againſt <hi>France.</hi> But for an Anſwer to their Addreſs, they ſhall know that I don't value neither them nor it ſo much as to anſwer any thing of that Nature, without the concurrent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the other Houſe, which may perhaps throw a Bone of Contention betwixt them.</p>
               <p>The Storm increaſes inſtead of abating; and now they addreſs a ſecond time to alarm the Nation, as if they lay under imminent Dangers from the Clandeſtine Practices of ill
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98018:136"/> Men; and urge to have the Duke of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale</hi> removed from my Preſence; which they back with a Vote that they will give no Money till they be ſecur'd from Popery and Arbitrary Government: a terrible Alarm from the Repreſentatives of a Nation, who are look'd upon as the Preſervers of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Liberties. I know no other way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this Diſaſter, than by proroguing the Parliament to allay their Heat; and in the mean time take care to have my Proceedings juſtified from the Pulpits. Nor am I any happier in the French King's Friendſhip, he is far from being punctual or true to his Word, and by conſequence hath fail'd of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me the 300000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> which he promiſed. And I have another Evidence of the Miſchief that attends a King's being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to his Subjects for Money; that the French King does in an inglorious manner threaten to diſcover our private Treaties to the Parliament, and to create a Rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me and my People, if I preſs him too hard. Had I the Purſes and Perſons of my Subjects at command, as he has his, I ſhould as little value his Kindneſs as he does mine: Or could I but have ſubdued thoſe irregular Paſſions which have enſlav'd my Soul with the Baits of ſenſual Pleaſure, I needed not have been oblig'd to him for Money. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98018:137"/> ſeeing Fate hath brought me into thoſe Circumſtances, I muſt do my beſt to get out of them as well as I can; and order my Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> to retard the Peace, that by the proſpect of a War I may draw Money from the Parliament. And the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſtop the Peace, my Plenipotentiary at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> ſhall have Orders to demand the free Exerciſe of the Catholick Religion throughout the Dominions of the States, which I know they will not grant; but by this Means I ſhall recommend my ſelf to the Pope's Nuncio: and the zealous Catholicks, who ſeeing my own Forwardneſs, will ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Pope and Conclave of <hi>Rome</hi> to give me Aſſiſtance; and then perhaps I ſhall be able to carry on the Deſign my ſelf, without the French King's Concurrence, and reap all the Glory alone.</p>

               <p>THE Treaty of Peace being no longer to be conceal'd, I muſt now acquaint my Parliament with it; and becauſe I know they will be for disbanding my Army upon it, I will urge for Reaſons to the contrary, the common Maxim, that it's beſt treating with Sword in hand, and therefore inconvenient for me to disband my Army, or lay up my Fleet till the Peace be fully concluded. And ſeeing this cannot be done without Supplies, I muſt preſs for renewing of the additional Exciſe, and making up the Defect of the Poll-Bill; for the more I have of their Money, the leſs they will be able to rebel: and to render them as little ſuſpicious as may be of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98018:138"/> my Deſigns, I will offer it to their choice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to provide for their Subſiſtence till a Peace be concluded, or to furniſh Money to disband them, with an aſſurance that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ill Men may ſuggeſt, my Deſigns were always levelled at the Publick Good. But let me take what Meaſures I can, the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of my Parliament will never be quieted; and, to my Grief, I perceive that they ſmell my Deſigns, which are only to poſſeſs my ſelf of their Money, and keep up an Army to render my ſelf abſolute: They dread that the Souldiers will rather make themſelves Work than be idle; and therefore have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that the Army is burdenſom to the Nation; that they will ſupport me in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a War againſt <hi>France,</hi> or otherwiſe provide for disbanding them. Seeing they are ſo very hot, it's my Intereſt to cool them, which cannot be better effected than by a mild Anſwer; and to offer them as a Reaſon, that ſeeing hitherto the French King hath only granted a Ceſſation, and not a Peace, it's fit that I ſhould continue my Fleet and Army till the latter be agreed on, and in the mean time to preſs for Money for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
               <p>What a miſchievous thing is this horrid Suſpicion, which cauſes Men to pry into one another's Secrets, and obliges Princes to be on
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98018:138"/> their Guard againſt their own Subjects! And yet though I carry it with all imaginable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſy, it's impoſſible for me to avoid being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and in a great meaſure traced: they whiſper about, that I never rais'd this Army with a Deſign to disband them; and being afraid that I ſhould have Money from <hi>France</hi> to maintain them, are reſolv'd to furniſh me wherewith to diſcharge them, though I have earneſtly preſſed for their Continuance. And thus it is to be a Soveraign by halves. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it not being ſafe to controvert the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too far, I am reſolv'd to paſs the disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Act, but will obſerve it no further than ſutes my Meaſures. I am pretty well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to Violation of Oaths, which have a degree of Solemnity beyond mere Acts of Parliament. The Money which they give to disband them, will ſerve for ſome time to maintain them; and then I may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe provided, or make them at leaſt provide for themſelves, and earn their Bread before they eat it. It's ſtrange that I may not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon that which <hi>Oliver</hi> the Uſurper did before me: He was ſo far from being check'd by his Parliaments, that he gave Laws to them by his Army; and why may not I attempt the like? And though I be ſworn to the contrary, yet may defend it as he did, by Reaſons of State, until ſuch time
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:98018:139"/> as I arrive at that height of Power, as to make my Will paſs for a Law: But this is more eaſily hop'd for than effected. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if I can handſomly weather out this Storm, it's not impoſſible to be brought to paſs.</p>

               <p>IT's ſome Comfort to have Fellows, though it be but in Affliction.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98018:140"/> this to the French King, who upbraids me with it as a Breach of the private Treaty, that my Son and Subjects ſhould fight againſt him: I can truly ſay, that neither the Duke nor they did engage in that Action with my Conſent; and that the thing is wholly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whoſe Conduct and Courage, I have reaſon to dread, will mar all the Deſigns which <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. and I have ſo long concerted. This Diſaſter makes it neceſſary to conclude a Peace, and then we may contrive at leiſure how to retrieve it.</p>
               <p>The Peace being concluded, I muſt recal my Forces, which now I perceive become grievous to the Spaniards; and I hope to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them to better purpoſe at home than ever they were abroad. Let the Phanaticks mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and belch out their ſeditious Reflections upon my violating the Act for disbanding the Forces, I am Proof againſt ſuch Tongue-ſhot as theirs: I can find out a Pretence for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſtill on foot, as being neceſſary to over-awe the French, who being now at Peace with every body elſe, may reaſonably be thought to have Deſigns againſt me, as having firſt obliged them to the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> and now by my Forces have contributed to bring them to a Peace. Theſe Regiments being brought over from <hi>Flanders,</hi> will reſtrain the Tumnlts which I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98018:140"/> to fear from the mutinous Humour in which my Subjects are at preſent; and in a little time I can augment my Army, if I had but Money. It's true, that in the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult divers Expedients were propoſed for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, either from the French King, the City of <hi>London,</hi> or the Parliament: But to have it from the former can never be relied on; and if he ſupply me once, I am not ſure that he will do it a ſecond time, his own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Deſigns having carv'd him out Ways enough for his Money: Neither is it ſafe for me to be ſo much obliged to him, leſt he ſhould at ſome time or other improve it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, as he did lately threaten to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our ſecret Intrigues to the Parliament, when we charg'd him with being worſe than his Word, and failing in the Money which he had promiſed for the common Deſign. I know the Ambition of his Heart inclines him to aſpire to the Univerſal Monarchy; and therefore I muſt be on my Guard againſt him. The Propoſal of borrowing Money from the City of <hi>London</hi> I know impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they have already denied me Credit; and it's nothing but to render my ſelf too mean to deſire Money of them again. The Project of bringing them to it by Force were no more than what they merit, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences may prove fatal to my Deſigns. The
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98018:141"/> City of <hi>London</hi> being the Head of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, has a natural Influence on the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick; and if the City be once enraged, I muſt not expect to have the Kingdom long in quiet: And I have the more reaſon to be cautious on this Head, becauſe the Loſs of the City was the Loſs of my Father's Life. It's true that my Lord <hi>Clifford</hi>'s Advice of declaring my ſelf bare-fac'd, and out-braving all Difficulties, were a thing very beſeeming a Monarch: but my Experience is greater than his; <hi>Dulce Bellum inexpertum,</hi> War is ſweet till it be tried. Had he three Crowns to loſe, as I have, his Courage would not be ſo great: for he that never enjoyed the Sweets of Life, does not know how to value them; but I have had Experience both what it is to want and poſſeſs them. I know that this Nation, though very well prepar'd by that which Phanaticks and Men of their Kidney call Profanity, is not yet ripe enough to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace down-right Popery. The Miſcarriage of the Father may very well ſerve as a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Son: He fell in an Attempt leſs obnoxious; and I have no great reaſon to hope for better Succeſs in one which is more diſpleaſing. The People are very well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as much of Popery as Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> left; and whoever deſigns to introduce more, muſt do it inſenſibly, by promoting
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98018:141"/> ſuch Clergy-men as are Well-wiſhers to it; bringing in Favourers of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks into the Univerſity by ſide-Winds, and filling all Places of Power and Truſt with thoſe who are for the Deſign: But it is not ſafe for me to truſt my ſelf to the Conduct of ſuch furious Men as <hi>Clifford,</hi> who has not Prudence enough to govern himſelf. It can not be defended by any ſort of Politicks to treat a Perſon who is capable of divulging an important Secret in that manner, as he did the Gentleman who overheard us at the door, that being the very Method to have it made publick: and therefore though for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency which I ſhould thereby reap in the Adminiſtration of my Government, I could wiſh as well as he or any other, that Popery were eſtabliſh'd; yet ſeeing I believe that all Religion is the Contrivance of Politicians, I ſhall never hazard my own Quiet for any one ſort of it. As for the laſt Propoſal of getting Money from the Parliament, I am reſolv'd to try it, and muſt be preparing my Arguments before-hand to move them to grant it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LXVI.</hi> On the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot in <hi>Auguſt, 1678.</hi> by Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and others. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Jeſuits againſt his Majeſty's Life. Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s taking Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Depoſitions. The ſeizing of <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Secretary to the Dutcheſs of <hi>York,</hi> and his Papers; and the murdering of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundbury Godfrey</hi> thereupon.</head>
               <p>NEver was there any Prince ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Capricio's of Fortune as my ſelf: So that of all Men alive I am the leaſt obliged to offer Incenſe at her Altars. In my Youth I was expell'd my Dominions by Phanaticks and Enthuſiaſts; ſince my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration I have been continually perplex'd by the perverſe and ſtubborn Humours of the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-men, though I reſtored their Diſcipline: and now my Life is ſought after by the Roman Catholicks, whom I have ſo much oblig'd in the whole Courſe of my Reign, even to the hazard of my Crown and Government. I perceive that my ſeeming Neutrality enrages the Bigots of all Parties againſt me: And hence the Jeſuits do now
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98018:142"/> ſeek to diſpatch me, becauſe I am not willing to follow my Lord <hi>Clifford</hi>'s Advice, and go their pace. They promiſe themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Succeſs in their Deſigns, conſidering the French King's Power, my Brother's Zeal for their Church, and the Conſtitution of my preſent Army: and becauſe I am not willing to puſh on further than I conceive is for my Intereſt, they are therefore willing to rid themſelves of me. O ungrateful and miſchievous Generation! I am now convinc'd that it's not without Reaſon that the Society of the Jeſuits is hateful even to ſome Catholick Countries; and that their Motto, <hi>Cavete vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Principes,</hi> is proper enough for them: yet ſuch are my Circumſtances, that I dare not teſtify my Hatred to their Order, becauſe of their revengeful and vindictive temper. They who did not ſpare two <hi>Henries</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> though profeſſed Catholicks, will never ſpare me who am eſteem'd a Proteſtant: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though I do not love them, I dare not avow that I hate them; for they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be dreaded for their Courage but for their Conduct, which is very obſervable in this Particular. They know that I have all along kept down the Phanaticks; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they had ſucceeded in their Murder, would have fathered it upon them; and for this end have, by their Intereſt amongſt my
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98018:143"/> Courtiers, got Mr. <hi>Cleypool,</hi> Son-in-law to the late Uſurper, committed to the Tower, as having had a Deſign againſt my Perſon. This they did reaſonably conclude would have obtain'd Belief amongſt the Vulgar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Diſgrace I put on his Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law's Corps, and my Severity againſt the whole Herd of Diſſenters; and by this means the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have been ſo inflam'd againſt the Phanaticks, that they would have done the Jeſuits Work to their hand, by ruining their Brethren, and ſo weakning themſelves. Yet thanks to my Stars I have eſcaped the Snare; and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warned, can provide for my own Safety, though it will be a very hard Matter to eſcape their Fury: Nor do I know any better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod than by my Brother's Intereſt to aſſure them of being favourably dealt with, and make as if I did not believe the Accuſation. By this means I ſhall prevent thoſe Efforts of their Revenge which their own Preſervation may put them upon, if they think that I do really believe them guilty; for I doubt not but my Brother and they both will be ready to capitulate with me on theſe Terms, that they may enjoy my Protection againſt the Reſentments of the Nation, who are terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly incens'd by Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Diſcovery, and the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> for
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98018:143"/> taking his Depoſitions. Nor am I indeed any further pleas'd with this Detection of the Conſpiracy than as to what concerns my own perſonal Danger; for my Meaſures were well laid to have effected what they do ſo violently deſire, but their Precipitance and too much Haſte hath ſpoiled all.</p>
               <p>By Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Treachery to the Catholicks, with whom he was engaged, it's eaſy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Conſpiracies are dangerous, and that all Men are not to be intruſted with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of State; for let Eccleſiaſticks of all Perſwaſions inculcate the binding Force of Oaths as much as ever they pleaſe, yet when it comes to their own turn, they break or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them according as their Intereſt directs. The Danger of Conſpiracies may be further obſerved from <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Conduct; Princes had need to be well aſſured of the Fidelity of thoſe whom they intruſt with their Secrets. Could any Man have imagin'd that one in his Station ſhould have been ſo blab-tongu'd, or that he would not have been more careful to have conceal'd his Papers? It's for my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Intereſt and mine both, that he ſhould ſuffer Death, though it's our Policy to feed him with Hopes of a Reprieve at the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, left out of Revenge for our dropping him he ſhould diſcover what he knows. And tho the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98018:144"/> yet it's juſtifiable enough by Reaſons of State, it's better that he ſhould fall, than that the Crown ſhould be made to totter, as it muſt certainly have done, if what <hi>Coleman</hi> had told him ſhould have been publickly known: for I could neither in Honour nor Safety have abandon'd my Brother, which would both have endangered my Throne and Reputation, it being impoſſible for him to have been brought to a publick Trial, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Diſcovery how far I am concern'd in the Plot. However, to prevent popular Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, which would certainly happen if none of thoſe who are accus'd be brought to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, I muſt ſeem to countenance the Proſecution of the Plot to prevent the Peoples having any Pretence for executing Juſtice themſelves; which, by the great Multitude of Swordmen that attended Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Corps to the Grave, I may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conjecture they have Inclination enough to do. And ſeeing theſe hot-headed Fellows who were intruſted with the Commiſſion to kill him, had ſo little Prudence as to commit the Fact within the Verge of my Conſort's Palace, it behoves me to give way to Juſtice againſt them, leſt the world ſhould think it had been contriv'd at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> And the time of the Parliament's Meeting drawing near, I muſt be very cautious how I take my
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98018:144"/> Meaſures, and contrive in what manner it's fit to accoſt them.</p>

               <p>THE Parliament being to meet, I muſt bethink my ſelf of an Apology for not disbanding my Army according to the Act. And ſeeing they inſiſted ſo much upon the Preſervation of <hi>Flanders,</hi> as the Barrier of this Nation, I muſt urge the Neceſſity there was of keeping them on foot for that end, and ſo turn their own Arguments againſt them; which will, by the Aſſiſtance of my Friends, draw a Vail before the Peoples Eyes; and at the ſame time this affords me a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reaſon for demanding Money, as having
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98018:145"/> ſpent what they gave me laſt to maintain the Army. And if this ſhould raiſe Heats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as I have Reaſon to think it may, I ſhall thence have a juſtifiable Pretence for proroguing them again, as deſigning a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Invaſion of the Rights of the Crown. And by this means I ſhall acquit my ſelf of my Promiſes to the Catholicks, in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thorow Scrutiny into their late Plot; and give thoſe hot-headed Bigots, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended my Death, a convincing Evidence, how neceſſary it is for them in their preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to preſerve my Life: for if I ſhould happen to miſcarry at this Juncture, when the Kingdom is in a Ferment, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Conſpiracy, it will certainly iſſue in the Ruine of their Affairs, and the perpetual Excluſion of my Brother from the Throne, his Enjoyment of which is the thing that they expect with ſo much Impatience.</p>
               <p>But that I may the better ſcreen my ſelf from the Jealouſies of the Parliament, it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that I ſhould inform them of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot, and the Danger of my Perſon, and the Proteſtant Religion, if they don't fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on effectual means to prevent it. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Juſtice give any reaſonable Ground of Offence to my Friends the Catholicks, ſeeing I only diſſemble to do them the more Service. Nor have they any greater reaſon to be angry
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98018:145"/> at my ſuffering ſome of the inferiour ſort to be cut off, and ſome of the chief ones com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it being always good Policy rather to loſe a Part than hazard the whole. This I ſhall take care to impart to the great ones: and ſo long as I ſecure my Intereſt with them, I need not value the other.</p>
               <p>The Commons, I perceive, are not to be diverted by a falſe Scent, as I did hope they would by my Apology for continuing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and new Demand of Money, but are now very eager in purſuit of the Plot, and have voted it a damnable Deſign to root out their Religion and Government, have procured Warrants to apprehend the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Stafford, Arundel, Peters</hi> and <hi>Bellaſis;</hi> ſo that I muſt of neceſſity comply with committing them to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where I ſhall take care to keep them <hi>in ſalva,</hi> though not <hi>in arcta cuſtodia,</hi> and by that means ſave them from popular Fury. By my compliance in this I ſhall the better ſtave off the Odium of refuſing the Bill for raiſing the Militia, though the Commons have voted it as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for their Safety. And I can eaſily palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate my ſo doing under the Notion of a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for my Prerogative, which being an old Plea, can never be ſuſpected of being fram'd on purpoſe to favour the Plot, though at the ſame time I have no more Cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98018:146"/> my ſelf on the Fidelity of the Country, than they have to entruſt me with a Standing Army. I have met with no ſuch Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of late from their Civil Repreſentatives in Parliament, as to make me confide in their Military Repreſentatives in an Army: The Militia of the Nation were never Friends to my Father; nor do I know what reaſon they have for a greater Reſpect to the Son. If I ſhould gratify the Commons in this, I have reaſon to dread the Iſſue; for having been ſo bold as to libel my Adminiſtration when they had no Forces to back them, I have no reaſon to doubt but that they would advance a Step higher, if they ſhould have an Army which they could depend upon. Let them exclaim againſt my Conduct, for denying to raiſe the Militia, though at the ſame time they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with an illegal Army, as loud as they can, I am to prefer my own Intereſt to their Humour, and will always value my own Prerogative and Pleaſure above the Will of my Subjects, who were born for me, and not I for them, according to the Doctrine of their own beloved Church, which can never ſtand if Popery fall: and I doubt not but their Clergy will quickly have their Eyes open to ſee it; for whenever the Tide runs ſtrong againſt Popery, their Biſhops decline, and Diſſenters are favoured: and whenever the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98018:146"/> Stream is turn'd againſt the Phanaticks, the Mitres triumph, and Papiſts are encouraged: of which my Father's Reign and mine have afforded many incontrovertible Inſtances; and I doubt not but the Event will verify my having been a true Prophet.</p>
               <p>Foul Water quenches Fire as well as that which is clean: and ſo the Death of ſome of the meaneſt Plotters will ſatisfy the preſent Reſentments of the People. And thus the greateſt of Cities will condemn their own Suburbs to Deſtruction in caſe of a Siege, ſo they can but ſave the Body of the Place. The Heathen Romans thought it their Honour to devote themſelves to the Infernal Gods to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a Battel in hazard to be loſt; and why ſhould not the Chriſtian Romans follow their Example? Thoſe ordinary Fellows who have ſuffered on account of the Plot, will have more than a ſufficient Compenſation by a Place in the Roman Kalendar of Saints; ſo that they have no reaſon to upbraid me for ſuffering the Law to take place againſt them; ſince, according to their own Doctrine, their Martyrdom does not only merit a Releaſe from Purgatory, but the Enjoyment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf: And by the ſacrificing of <hi>Coleman</hi> I ſhall gain this Point, that the Vulgar will think I proſecute the Plot in good earneſt; whereas at the ſame time I puniſh him for his
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98018:147"/> too great Freedom of Speech, and prevent his uſing the like for time to come. Nor can the Papiſts themſelves blame me for it, when they conſider how much I am expos'd in his Letters, which diſcover my Intrigues with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> and that he was ſo much a Fool as to have Copies of them by him.</p>

               <p>MY Penſions and Favours have been ill beſtowed, ſince they are uſeleſs to me now in my greateſt Strait. The Current of the Houſe runs ſo ſtrong upon the Plot, that I muſt find out ſome Method to ſtem the Tide. They are now ſo bold as to ſtrike at
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98018:147"/> my Brother, which is as much as if they ſhould bid me to look to my ſelf. I have gain'd one Point by the Aſſiſtance of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Court-Lords, that though the Bill to prevent Catholicks from ſitting in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was principally levelled againſt him, yet I have got a Clauſe added to except him: and though it's true that this is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring him a Papiſt to the World, yet the Reaſons for my doing ſo out-weigh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences: for now the Catholicks will be the leſs preſſing upon me to declare my ſelf of their Party; when, beſides the Stratagem which I formerly uſed to make my Brother declare himſelf, by threatning that I would ſue for a Divorce, and marry another Wiſe, by whom I might have Children, I have now got his Religion declar'd in Parliament. But becauſe this will rather alarm than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Nation, I don't find it convenient to continue this Parliament any longer, leſt they ſhould at laſt become head-ſtrong and ungovernable: And rather than be control'd by them, to whom I have given ſo much Money to ſo little purpoſe, I had rather have my Deſigns check'd by another, for I have but ſmall Hopes of having a better. But this Advantage I ſhall reap from the Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it will ſtop the farther Enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Popiſh Plot for a time, and give my
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98018:148"/> Friends the Catholicks a Breathing, by which they may recover from their Conſternation, and take ſuch Meaſures as are beſt for their Intereſt. At the ſame time I ſhall have ſome liberty to enjoy my Pleaſures, for that's the way whither the Biaſs of my Soul inclines; and without diſſolving this factious Divan, I could neither have ſo well provided for my Brother's Safety, nor the Deſires of thoſe charming Beauties, in whoſe Careſſes I place my chief Happineſs; for I had rather repoſe my Head in <hi>Venus</hi>'s Lap, than be ſtrutting in the Field with <hi>Mars</hi>'s Helmet.</p>
               <p>The Diſſolution of the Parliament at ſuch a Juncture, I know will render me liable to abundance of Cenſures; and, amongſt others, that I have done it to ſtifle the Diſcovery of the Plot: I muſt therefore take ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as will ſerve me for a Shield againſt this Accuſation; which, together with the calling of a new Parliament, may be an Argument for me in the Mouth of my Friends. Nor can I think of a better Expedient than by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my Brother to leave the Kingdom for a time, but with all Aſſurances imaginable of my inviolable Friendſhip: And this, with the ſuffering of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers to be brought to Trial, will at leaſt blind the Eyes of the unthinking ſort, and make my Pretences of having diſſolved the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:98018:148"/> Parliament on the account of their frequent Entrenchments upon my Prerogative, the more credible.</p>
               <p>The new Parliament being met, I laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them my Deſigns to unite the Minds of my Subjects; that in order thereunto I had excluded the Popiſh Lords from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, executed ſeveral of the Plotters, and Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Murderers; that I had moreover disbanded as much of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as I had Money to do it with, and will disband the reſt when they enable me; that, to take away all Subject of Cavil, I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my Brother from my Dominions; and that I was ready to join with them in any good Laws againſt Popery: and, to drive the nail home, did plainly confeſs my having been formerly miſled by Cabals, and declare my Reſolution of governing henceforth by the Advice of my Parliaments and Privy-Council: and, to pleaſe them further, did chooſe ſuch Perſons for Members of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as were known to be Zealots both for their Liberties and Religion. By this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I quieted the Ferment in which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of People were, and ſav'd my ſelf from a ſudden and tumultuary Revolution; and at the ſame time my Friends the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks had leiſure to provide for themſelves, and my Brother withdrew from the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:98018:149"/> Storm with Safety. But this I perceive was not durable, for the popular Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors finding that I only made uſe of them for the Credit of my Affairs, did quickly grow weary, and deſire to be diſmiſſed: and now my new Houſe of Commons inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſame Courſes which the former had taken, go on to impeach the Popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and have voted a Bill to diſable my Brother from inheriting the Imperial Crown of this Realm; and to make this go down the more ſmoothly with the People, they aſſign, as the Cauſe of their Vote, that the Hopes of his Succeſſion hath been the chief Cauſe of this Conſpiracy for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of my ſelf, and altering the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. By this Means they would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Kingdom with Fears of unavoidable Ruine to their Liberties and Religion, if the Duke be not excluded from ſucceeding to the Crown; and endeavour alſo to inſinuate their Loyalty in taking care for my Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but I have no great mind to truſt to their Friendſhip; their Predeceſſors in 1641. were as ample in their Proteſtations of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty as they, and yet took up Arms by my Father's Authority againſt his Perſon, and never made any ſtay till they cut off his Head. I know my ſelf to be much more criminal in their Senſe than ever he was; and that my
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98018:149"/> Concurrence in the Popiſh Plot can be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated with much more Eaſe than ever could his Commiſſion to the Iriſh Rebels: And I have no reaſon to doubt but they will think that a Concurrence with the Papiſts, to cut off the Engliſh Proteſtants, is a Crime of as heinous a Nature as that of deſtroying the Iriſh Proteſtants, and will certainly decree it as ſevere a Puniſhment; and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be blamed if, for my own Preſervation, I ſtudy how to give them a Diverſion.</p>

               <p>THough I be unſucceſsful and incumbred at home, yet my Allie the French
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98018:150"/> King is fortunate abroad; and, like a true Politician, does order his Affairs ſo as to make himſelf a Gainer both by Peace and War: Whether he gives Obedience to <hi>Mazarine's</hi> Dictates, as an obedient Son or tractable Scholar, I ſhall not determine; but ſure I am he puts his Commands in practice, and values Treaties no more than as they conduce to his Intereſt. However, it's more politick for him to ſeize thoſe Towns, as granted to him by Agreement under the Notion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancies, than under any other Pretence whatſoever. And this I rejoice in, not only as it contributes to promote the common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but alſo becauſe I have the Practice of ſo great a Monarch, as an Argument for my own Conduct; and the Authority of ſo great an Eccleſiaſtick as Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify me in point of Principle. But however well pleaſed I am with this Matter, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfied with his Treatment of my Brother, who is a kind of Exile for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Dictates, and therefore deſerved kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Entertainment at his hand: but I ſmell his Deſign, he is unwilling that his civil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception abroad ſhould extinguiſh his Deſire of returning home, becauſe he knows that his Preſence is neceſſary here to confirm the drooping Catholicks, and keep Life in his Party; for I know that he is jealous leſt I
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:98018:150"/> ſhould concur with my Parliament, rather than admit of an Interruption of my Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. As for the Unkindneſs of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, it is no Surprize; for whatever Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will they have to the Advancement of the Catholick Intereſt, yet they are angry at us for promoting that of <hi>France</hi> in oppoſition to theirs. And ſeeing the Caſe is ſo, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that my Brother ſhall return home.</p>
               <p>But I muſt firſt rid my ſelf of this Seſſion of Parliament; the Commons being ſo much overacted with Zeal, that they have preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with an Addreſs, wherein they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to defend my Perſon and the Proteſtant Religion, and to revenge any Violence that may be offered to me. They exclaim'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly againſt the Scots Covenant for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring their Endeavours, to defend my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according as he ſtood up in defence of their Religion, and now they themſelves run into the ſame Error, though the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of their Church pretended to teach and believe that Loyalty was an eſſential Point of their Religion: for now they join the Defence of my Perſon and that of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion together; which is as much as to ſay, that if I don't concur with them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the one, they will take no Care for the defence of the other. Then as for the revenging of any Violence that may be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98018:151"/> to my Perſon, I know what they aim at, but can provide for the defence of my ſelf better than they, or at leaſt in a way more agreeable to my Deſign. The Catholicks are not ſuch Fools as to cut me off now, for that were the way to ruine their Affairs, ſeeing my Brother's Intereſt is not yet eſtabliſh'd; ſo that I have no Fears on that Head yet. Neither have I any reaſon to truſt their fair Promiſes now that they have deprived me of the Defence of an Army which was modelled to my Mind: Beſides, it's below a Monarch to own that he needs the Defence of any one part of his Subjects againſt another, when he himſelf is born to defend the whole. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I muſt ſubmit to the Humour of the Multitude; and ſeeing I can neither have Money from <hi>France</hi> nor them to maintain my Army, I can the more eaſily diſpenſe with having them disbanded: And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding this Point I ſhall put ſome ſtop to the Jealouſies of the Nation; and my proroguing the Parliament to ſave the Popiſh Lords, whoſe Trial the Commons do ſo earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, will be of ſo much the eaſier Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And by this Favour to the Catholicks I ſhall engage them more firmly on my ſide; for the Intereſt of thoſe Lords, whoſe Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation depends on mine, will prevent Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations from the Bigots of their Party; and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:98018:151"/> during the Receſs of Parliament we ſhall have leiſure to recover our loſt Ground, and find out Expedients for taking off the Evidence of the Popiſh Plot that may not be ſo obnoxious to a Diſcovery as thoſe which have been made uſe of hitherto, which have rather confirm'd than diſcredited the Belief of the Plot.</p>

               <p>HAD my Subjects of the Epiſcopal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in <hi>England</hi> been as true to my Intereſt as their Brethren in <hi>Scotland,</hi> my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs would have appeared e're now in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Poſture.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98018:152"/> the Succeſſion and Adminiſtration of their Kings. My Epiſcopal Subjects in <hi>Scotland</hi> do on the contrary, make no ſcruple to put my Commands in execution, though againſt the Letter of the Law; and by a juſt Severity upon their Brethren the Presbyterians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the Laws in their ſtricteſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation will allow, they have procured this Inſurrection, which happen'd very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely for my Affairs. By this means I have not only humbled the Presbyterians there, and ſuppreſſed their rebellious Field-Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, but have a plauſible Pretence for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Laws ſtill more ſevere againſt them; forfeiting their Eſtates to gratify my hungry Courtiers; cutting off ſuch of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as I have in my hands; and ridding the Country of ſo many rebellious Fellows as I have taken Priſoners; ſo that I ſhall be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently reveng'd on the peſtilent Hereticks for the Lives of ſo many of my Friends the Catholicks as they have cut off on account of the Plot, which I was obliged to give way to to prevent being ſuſpected thereof my ſelf.</p>
               <p>I ſhall alſo gain this by the Scots Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whom I imployed as General to ſuppreſs it, will be thereby rendred the leſs popular amongſt the Presbyterians in that Nation, and their Friends the Diſſenters and Republicans here: So that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98018:152"/> if ever he attempt to aſcend the Throne, he will find it the more difficult, or at leaſt be made leſs capable of obſtructing the Deſign of introducing Popery, for his Zeal againſt which the Faction applaud him.</p>
               <p>I ſhall alſo make this Improvement of that Phanatical Inſurrection, that it will ſerve to alarm the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and convince them of the reſtleſs Endeavours of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to overturn their Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by conſequence make them the more apt to believe the Plots which ſhall henceforth be charg'd upon Phanaticks here to deſtroy the Government both in Church and State; which will be the beſt Expedient that we can think on to turn the Plot, which hath been proſecuted with ſo much Vigour againſt the Papiſts, upon their own Heretical Brethren the Diſſenters, from whom it's much eaſier to poſſeſs them with Apprehenſions of Danger, than from the Catholicks, becauſe their Intereſt is greater in the Nation; and that they have ſmarted by them more lately than by the other: And if I can do my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Friends this piece of Service, as I have not the leaſt reaſon to doubt but I ſhall, they may very well diſpenſe with my having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd ſome of their Prieſts and Jeſuits, that I might with the leſs Suſpicion advance their Cauſe.</p>

               <p>I thought that my Deſign of burying the Popiſh Plot in Oblivion, by fathering another upon the Presbyterians, could ſcarcely have miſſed taking effect, eſpecially when ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly managed by one of <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Parts; but the Fates are not yet propitious to my Endeavours, nor is the meaſure of my Croſſes entirely filled up. This Plot was ſufficiently well laid; and had thoſe Papers which were ſcattered in the Phanaticks Lodgings been but happily ſeiz'd, without ſuſpicion of any Tricks, the Presbyterian Plot would have paſſed for current, for I ſhould have been certain of having it trumpeted by the Clergy from their Pulpits: But ſeeing it hath prov'd abortive, I muſt take more care for time to come; and have no reaſon to deſpair of ſucceeding in ſome Attempt of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for I am ſure of having the Clergy on my ſide.</p>

               <p>THIS Parliament proving refractory as well as the other, I find my ſelf under a neceſſity of diſſolving them, for I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they will never be fit for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Perhaps the diſſolving of two ſuch Parliaments ſucceſſively may prevent the chooſing of another of the ſame ſtamp, and therefore I am reſolved to try the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the mean time I can, with the more Safety, recal my Brother; for if the Parliament be diſſolv'd, there's none elſe that dare to ask the Reaſon why. And if any of the Council ſhall dare to mutter againſt it,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98018:154"/> according to the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they ſhall be certainly diſcharged as well as he.</p>
               <p>The new Parliament is of the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion with the old. Whence I perceive that the Contagion hath ſpread ſo broad and wide in the Nation, that all Ranks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Perſons are infected: But ſeeing my Subjects are reſolved to be croſs, and chooſe ſuch Men to repreſent them in Parliament as thwart my Deſigns, I am reſolved to be as croſs to them, and prorogue the Parliament from time to time: ſo that if they are not like to anſwer my Deſign, they ſhall not have an opportunity of anſwering theirs, till I have taken ſuch previous Meaſures as I think fit for my purpoſe, and ſee whether I can have Money by any other Method. For which end I will try both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> and if neither of them anſwer my Ends, I ſhall have opportunity to attempt the buying off of ſome of the leading Members: And if that ſhould alſo miſcarry, I will ſend my Brother to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he may be out of their way, for I am ſure of his being well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd there by my Epiſcopal Council, who will order it ſo as to make him ſeem accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the whole Nation: and that will ſtrengthen his Party here; and at the ſame time ſuch of his Friends as find themſelves
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:98018:154"/> preſſed by the Stubbornneſs of the Engliſh Houſe of Commons, may find Sanctuary there under his Protection. I doubt nothing of the Zeal of the Scots Epiſcopal Party for his Intereſt, becauſe the Conſtitution of their Church makes them depend wholly on the Crown; and in that my Politicks prov'd very ſucceſsful, to have a Law for leaving the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their Church wholly at my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. Nor do I doubt but the particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which that Kingdom hath always evidenc'd to a Monarchical Government, and the ſingular Reſpect which they have hitherto ſhewed to <hi>Fergus</hi>'s Race, will have a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Influence on them, to preſerve the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in the right Line. And during theſe Prorogations I ſhall alſo have the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of making the Engliſh Clergy to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and order it ſo, that my <hi>durante bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placito</hi> Judges ſhall acquit ſuch of the Plotters as come to trial here; which will give a mighty ſtop to the Credit of the Conſpiracy, and be an Argument for the Nullity of the Plot from the Pulpits, when it's evident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand that it's disbelieved by the Bench, for the Colour of Juſtice adds very much Strength to any Cauſe.</p>

It was his Intereſt to create Jealouſies and Diſcontents betwixt me and my Subjects, not only to prevent our uniting againſt him, but that both of us might fall as an eaſier Conqueſt, though it's horribly inglorious for him to take ſuch Methods. But why ſhould I ſay thus, ſeeing all the great Princes that ever aſpir'd to the Univerſal Monarchy did make uſe of Fraud as well as Force? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, during my Life I ſhall prevent his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to cheat me of my Crown; and if I can carry on my Work without him, as it is the more hazardous, it will be alſo more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and by the Diviſions which have from time to time been carefully nouriſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt my Proteſtant Subjects, I doubt not but in time I may obtain my Deſires without his Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Parliament being met, they are as bad to the full as I ſuſpected, and tread in the ſame Steps with their Predeceſſors, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Fury upon ſuch of my Juſtices as obſtructed Petitions for their ſitting, and accuſe them as Betrayers of the Rights and Liberties of the People, becauſe they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed their Zeal for the Prerogatives of my Crown. Nor does their ſeditious Procedure ſtop here, but they have unanimouſly voted a Bill for excluding my Brother from the Crown, cut off the Earl of <hi>Stafford</hi> for his
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:98018:158"/> Acceſſion to the Plot, and impeach my Judges. The Fall of that Lord I muſt needs lament; but it is as venial for me to let him fall a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to popular Vengeance, as it was for my Father to give up the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> to his rebellious Parliament, though he was much more neceſſary to him than ever this Lord was to me. But as for the excluding of my Brother, and impeaching of my Judges, I muſt never give way to it, for that would infallibly iſſue in the Deſtruction of my ſelf. My ſtubborn Subjects have depriv'd me of my Army, ſo that I cannot eſtabliſh my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by the Sword; and if I ſuffer my ſelf to be likewiſe bereft of my Judges, then I ſhall be utterly diſabled from carrying on my Deſign, either by Military Power, or the Shadow of Law. As to the Excluſion of my Brother from ſucceeding to the Crown, it can in no manner be admitted. And here I have a very good Plea againſt them: The Clergy have preach'd up the Divine Right of a Lineal Succeſſion; and if that be ſo, I can maintain my Argument by the Laws of God; and I doubt not but my Judges will give it out as the Laws of the Land. If I ſhould give way to his Excluſion, it would weaken my ſelf, for then my Enemies might reaſonably act with the greater Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt me, when they ſhould be in no
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:98018:159"/> fear from my Succeſſor to puniſh ſuch a Practice.</p>
               <p>The Lords having thrown out the Bill by the Influence of the Biſhops Bench, is enough to juſtify me in the Eyes of the World; for why ſhould I conſent to the diſabling of my own Brother from ſucceeding to me upon the account of his being a Roman Catholick, when the Proteſtant Biſhops, who are the ghoſtly Fathers of their Church, make no Scruple to own his Right of Succeſſion, and teſtify their Hatred againſt the Bill? In this they have done me remarkable Service, and I doubt not but their Example will have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the Clergy. But to prevent all Suſpicion, as much as is poſſible, that I have any Deſign to re-eſtabliſh Popery, I will ſend them a Meſſage, that I am ready to agree to any other Expedients for ſecuring them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. And thus when I have made ſuch Proffers, and have the Biſhops and their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy on my ſide, it will look very preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in any Party whatever, ſo much as to whiſper a ſuſpicious Word of my Intentions. And if the Commons adhere tenaciouſly to their Bill, and refuſe to drop it, there's none who will dare to blame me if I diſſolve them.</p>

               <p>It is not without ſome appearance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that my ſtubborn Subjects do boaſt of the Divine Care and Providence which ſeems to watch over their Perſons, Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; for not only the Plots of Catholicks againſt them have been diſcovered and baffled, but all my Deſigns of faſtning Plots againſt them upon the Government have miſcarried. The Diſappointment of this, which was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> may be of very ill Conſequence, if there be not care taken to prevent, or at leaſt baffle his Diſcovery, which he has been ſuch a Fool as to make now that he is taken. How unhappy have I and my Courtiers been in the Tools that we choſe to carry on our Deſigns: for every one of them have not only diſcovered whatever they were imploy'd in, but alſo who ſet them at work; which incenſes the Nation againſt the Court. But without attempting we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſure of any thing; and it is ſome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction when we do miſcarry, to be able to ſay with <hi>Phaeton, Magnus tamen excidit auſis.</hi> This Deſign was conſiderable, though not ſucceſsful; for had the Plot but taken, and thoſe ſeditious Libels been found upon the Perſons to whom they were intended by the Penny-poſt, it would have afforded a plauſible Pretext for charging them with a Plot; and then I could have rid my ſelf of ſo
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98018:160"/> many dangerous Enemies by colour of Law. The Commons are ſenſible enough of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Deſign, and therefore have impeach'd <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> in order to have a full Diſcovery who ſet him at work, which to be ſure they would take care to publiſh through the Kingdom: but by my Intereſt in the Houſe of Lords I have got that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment rejected; and the Heat of the Commons in this, together with the Poſture which the <hi>London</hi>-Members came in to the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> will furniſh Pretence enough for diſſolving them, it being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intolerable that Subjects ſhould put ſuch mutinous Affronts upon their Prince, as to diſtinguiſh themſelves by Badges in their Hats, with printed Motto's upon them, to inſinuate as if I had a Deſign to introduce Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery. So that I doubt not but to make a good Improvement of this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Heat diſcovered by the Citizens, and can eaſily make it a ſufficient Ground-work to build a Plot on, that ſhall not be ſo apt to tumble down about the Ears of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as thoſe which have hitherto been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted; for here's Overt-act plain enough. It's not to be ſuppoſed that the Citizens and their Members did come in this poſture, without previous Conſultation: nor can it be thought that thoſe Lords and Commons
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:98018:161"/> who have ſo frequently complain'd of my Adminiſtration publickly, and are ſo much incens'd now at my oppoſing their Deſign of excluding my Brother, ſhould never have talk'd about thoſe Affairs in private Cabals, and propoſe Expedients to deliver themſelves from that which they call Popery and Slavery, the two things of which they are ſo much afraid. And if I can but prove any ſuch Conſults or Conferences, as I need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of effecting it by ſome falſe Brethren of their own, let them extenuate the matter as much as they pleaſe, by alledging that it was no more than what was talk'd in Parliament, and agreeable to the Aſſociation propos'd by the Commons, according to the Pattern of that ſigned in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, upon the account of Jealouſies of the ſame Nature. I ſay, let them make thoſe and a hundred more ſuch Apologies, if I can faſten it upon them, I ſhall prove it a Plot, and puniſh them accordingly for it. And if I ſucceed in this, as I have no great reaſon to doubt but I ſhall, ſeeing the Judges are made to my purpoſe, it will not only juſtify all the Meaſures which I have taken hitherto, but alſo ſuch Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as I may have occaſion to put in practice in time to come; for if once I get a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Plot to be believed and fix'd upon thoſe Lords and Commons who have always been
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:98018:161"/> moſt averſe to my Deſigns, and made the greateſt Clamour againſt the Court, then all that they have from time to time alledged of my Purpoſes to introduce Popery and Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will be look'd upon as the effect of Envy, and a mere Contrivance for the better carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of their Deſigns to overturn the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Church and State. And if once I get but ſome of them convicted by colour of Juſtice, then I may charge the Deſign upon the whole Party with Confidence; and I am ſure to be ſeconded by the Pulpit and the Bench, whoſe Arguments againſt the Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Plotters will have ſo much the more Weight, that the Parliament by their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would proceed to thwart me in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Succeſſion, which is unalterable by Divine Right, notwithſtanding of the fair Proffers which I made to them in my Speech, of concurring with the Trial of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and hearkning to any Expedients by which the Proteſtant Religion might be preſerved, and the Monarchy not deſtroyed. And ſeeing the Fathers of their own Church do own their Loyalty to be an eſſential Part of their Religion, and Monarchy to be of Divine Right; and that rather than break the Chain of Succeſſion, they are content to have a Popiſh King, which the other Party think ſo dangerous to their Religion, I may
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:98018:162"/> very well be excus'd to value the Monarchy and Succeſſion at leaſt as much as they; and I am ſure that I can't well value it higher, ſeeing it's apparent that they prefer it to their Religion, as probably thinking that to be the more diſputable Point of the two. And if it be ſo, as I have very great Reaſon to believe it is, I am the more confirm'd in my Scepticiſm as to all Religion; for that Monarchy is not thought to be the only Form of Government by Divine Inſtitution, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent enough, becauſe there are ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, both Proteſtant and Popiſh, which are all of them defended as lawful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the greateſt Doctors of both Churches. But ſeeing the Popiſh Clergy value their Religion above all ſorts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Governours, as appears by their exauctorating Kings, and defending their Murder or Dethronement when they fall off to Hereſy, I have reaſon to conclude that they are the more ſerious of the two; and with the other Arguments which they urge as the Antiquity, Univerſality, and Infallibility of their Church, this is to me a ſtrong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that their Religion is the trueſt of the two, ſeeing it has evidently more Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon its Followers, of which it has alſo the greateſt Number, and amongſt thoſe a great many Men of undeniable Learning and Parts.</p>

               <p>HEre I find a mighty Struggle of Nature againſt declaring my Son illegitimate; but ſeeing I have got over thoſe things which fooliſh Bigots reckon Divine, why ſhould I ſtand upon that which is merely humane? It's known to the World that I have violated thoſe Oaths which I made to God, then why ſhould I ſcruple to deny that I was ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Matrimonial Vow to any Woman but Queen <hi>Catharine?</hi> I had rather be eſteem'd wicked than weak, and have it ſaid, that I was unchaſte than fooliſh, as every one will conclude me to have been in doing as much as in me lay to ſacrifice the Intereſt of my Crown to an impotent Paſſion, for a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Woman; and that for the Satisfaction of my preſent Deſires I ſhould have hazarded a Deprivation of all my future Dignities, by contracting ſuch a mean Alliance as would not have excited the Compaſſion, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd me to the Contempt of other Sovereign Princes. It's true, my Brother <hi>James</hi> may, for one reaſon, juſtly condemn me in his
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:98018:163"/> Heart, becauſe I would not let him diſown his Match upon the Foreſight of my Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, though in ſtrictneſs he has no Reaſon, ſeeing our Circumſtances do ſo much differ. His Father-in-law would have reſented ſuch an Injury to the utter Diſappointment of my Return, if I ſhould have contenanc'd him in that Deſign; but there is no ſuch hazard in my Caſe now. And if he ſhould have any hard Thoughts of me upon that account, he's very ungrateful, ſeeing it is chiefly for his ſake that I do it, though at the ſame time I have alſo a Proſpect to the Merit, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Roman Doctrine attends ſuch Actions as are done for the Advancement of the Catholick Church, that in caſe there be any ſuch thing as a future Reward for ſuch good Deeds, I may by this Means inſure it; and at the ſame time I revenge my ſelf on this undutiful Son, for aſſociating himſelf with thoſe who are my Enemies, and have all along oppos'd my Deſigns. Private Men do many times diſinherit their Children upon Diſguſts, and why ſhould not a Monarch have the ſame Liberty? My great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, declared her Son, my Grandfather, a Baſtard, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his ſucceeding her, becauſe he was educated in the Proteſtant Religion; and ſhe being enregiſtred as a Saint in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:98018:163"/> Kalendar, it can be no Crime to follow her Example.</p>
               <p>This Procedure may be alſo juſtified from Reaſons of State; ſeeing he is become ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular amongſt thoſe who are Enemies to my Government, they may perhaps take upon them to make him Head of a Rebellion againſt me, and think to juſtify themſelves by his Right of Succeſſion, and the Intereſt which he has to preſerve the Nation upon its true Baſis: So that the moſt effectual way to give a Check to any ſuch Deſigns, which I have Reaſon from his Circular Journies into the Country to ſuſpect may be <hi>in embrio,</hi> is to declare him illegitimate, which will leſſen his Reputation, ſeeing it will eaſily obtain Belief, that I would not declare him illigiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, if it were not ſo, merely for the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of my younger Days, when I profeſſed ſo much Piety, that I may not be thought to have acted the Hypocrite from my Cradle.</p>

               <p>THE Parliament being now diſſolved, and I by Conſequence at liberty from ſuch an impertinent Check, it's convenient for me to carry on my Deſigns with all imaginable Vigour; and having found an opportunity againſt one of the Faction, who was a talkative meddling Fellow, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have him tried for High-treaſon at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>London</hi>-Jury have acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98018:164"/> him. Let the Faction complain of its being contrary to Law, and what elſe they pleaſe, it's for my Intereſt that he ſhould be cut off, to be a Terror to others, and gain Belief to the Plot: <hi>Oxford</hi> being a Place of noted Loyalty, I doubt not of having him found guilty there, ſeeing I have Evidences enough ready, who will ſwear treaſonable Words againſt him; and he being once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, it will not only reflect upon all the reſt who attended the <hi>London</hi>-Members to <hi>Oxford,</hi> but upon the Members themſelves, and the whole Party of Lords and Commons that countenanc'd the Bill of Excluſion. And I am certain of this Advantage againſt all of them, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> will be their Enemies, becauſe of the Favour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which they have evidenced to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters. And when <hi>Colledge</hi> ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by due Forms of Law, it will reflect upon the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> for having pick'd ſuch a Jury as acquitted him.</p>
               <p>Having begun with <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> and been ſucceſsful in my Endeavours, I am now reſolv'd on higher Game, and therefore have caus'd the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> to be ſeiz'd as Ring-leaders of the Faction. It's true that I could not promiſe my ſelf ſuch Succeſs in <hi>London</hi> as I had in <hi>Oxford;</hi> but however in attempting it I have
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98018:165"/> gain'd thus much, that of the Crimes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was charged, ſome will be believed; and his being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted in <hi>London</hi> will furniſh me with far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground of Quarrel againſt the City, and countenance my <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt their Charter, as to which I am ſure of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Judges: And if I could once but humble that Source of Rebellion, it would render the reſt of my Work eaſy throughout the Nation: And if the Charters of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were once in my poſſeſſion, I ſhall be able to chooſe what Men I pleaſe to repreſent them in Parliaments, which will be no ſmall Advantage to my Deſigns. It is indeed a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bold and daring Attempt; but finding that hitherto my Proceedings have met with no Oppoſition by way of Arms, I have the more Encouragement to go on, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have got the Church on my ſide, who are happily alarm'd with the Inſinuations of their own Danger from the oppoſite Party: ſo that I doubt not of bringing this Affair to a happy Concluſion, by letting the hungry Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Juſtices looſe upon the Diſſenters Eſtates, and giving thoſe of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors-Commons</hi> a full Power over their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and Purſes; by which means the Party will eaſily be prevail'd on to believe that my ſeizing of the Charters is only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98018:165"/> to exclude Diſſenters from bearing any ſhare in the Magiſtracy of the Nation, or aſſiſting in the choice of Parliament-men: ſo that if once I get a Houſe of Commons mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled to my mind, I can eaſily make my party good in the Houſe of Lords; and then I or my Succeſſors may effectuate, by the Peoples ſeeming Conſent, what hitherto we have not been able to accompliſh. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>London</hi> having behaved it ſelf ſo rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly, I am reſolv'd to be further reveng'd upon them, and to deprive them of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of chooſing Sheriffs, for oppoſing me, in which ſome of the moſt Factious are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy committed: And becauſe the Herd of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks did unanimouſly concur with them, I ſhall take care to have them duly proſecuted and puniſhed according as their Merits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>My Epiſcopal Subjects in <hi>Scotland</hi> have acted their part, and evidenc'd a Loyalty without any Reſerve, having diſpens'd with my Brother's not taking of the Oath which was incumbent on him, as Commiſſioner, and ſettled the Succeſſion without any Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: They have, however, enacted a Teſt for the Security of their Religion, which I can eaſily aſſent to, for pleaſing of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and furniſhing the Epiſcopal Party an Anſwer to the Reproaches of their Brethren
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98018:166"/> the Phanaticks, who alledg that they have no Zeal for the Religion which they profeſs. But though I am very well ſatisfied with my Friends Loyalty, yet in truth I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Policy, that they ſhould not have taken more care to avoid ſuch plain Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in their Teſt, as furniſh Objections againſt it, not only to the Phanaticks, but alſo to many of their own Party. It's true, they are the more excuſable, that herein they were out-witted by ſome of the oppoſite Faction; who, though they had a hand in the framing it, refuſe it themſelves: but I took care to have had the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for his Behaviour in that Affair; whereby I ſhould not only have puniſh'd him for his own and his Father's former Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but have alſo deprived the oppoſite Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Head, but the croſs Fates have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed his Eſcape: Yet I am ſo much a Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the Affair, that his forfeited Eſtate will reward ſome of my zealous Friends, and his Sentence will terrify the reſt of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as it hath pleaſed my Church-of-<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Zealots, becauſe of his Inclination to the Scotiſh Kirk. This Behaviour of the Parliament and Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> will mightily ſtrengthen my Friends of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in their eſpouſing mine and my Brother's Cauſe, which will not a

               </head>
               <p>THE Citizens, I perceive, continue ſtill tumultuous, and are mighty tenacious in aſſerting the Right of chuſing their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, though there is a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Charter. It is therefore my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to puniſh thoſe who incourage them, that for time to come they may be deterr'd from ſuch Practices; and therefore I ſhall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſo that my Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Alderman <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:98018:167"/> and ſuch other noted Citizens as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance their Proceedings, ſhall be indited as Rioters; and I doubt not of having them found guilty accordingly: which will both reflect upon their Credit, and affect their Eſtates.</p>
               <p>But all this while I play at nothing but ſmall game; and this way of proving Plots by Conſequence and Inferences is not ſo ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the Publick: for the Faction evades them, by alledging that all thoſe things with which they are charg'd amount to no more than a zealous Appearance for their Liberties, to which they have a Right by Law; ſo that I muſt find out a Method to charge their Ringleaders with ſomething of a more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Nature, that may appear odious in the Eyes of the World; and not only render the Perſons, but the Cauſe alſo hateful: By which means I ſhall be juſtified in cutting off the Chief of the Faction, as the Lord <hi>Ruſſel, Algernon Sidney,</hi> &amp;c. and afford a plauſible Pretext for committing the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and others. But ſeeing it will be look'd upon as improbable that ſuch Perſons as the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould be concern'd in any mean or baſe Deſign againſt my Life, or my Brother's, by way of Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I have taken order that the Plot ſhall
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:98018:167"/> conſiſt of two Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> one of levying War againſt me to overturn the Government in Church and State, whereof thoſe great Men above-named ſhall be given out as the Managers; which as it will juſtify the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of my having declared the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> illegitimate, ſo it will be the more readily believ'd that he is engag'd in ſuch a Deſign to revenge that Affront. The other part of the Plot, which ſhall be given out as a Deſign to have aſſaſſinated my ſelf and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> I have, by the Advice of ſome of my Confidents, laid it ſo as to have it charg'd upon meaner Perſons, as <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott, Rumbold,</hi> &amp;c. And being provided with the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſcrick,</hi> and other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences fit for my purpoſe, the Matter ſhall be ſworn boldly home. And thus ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge my ſelf on thoſe Men who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd with ſo much Zeal againſt me and my Brother, and rid our ſelves of ſuch dangerous Enemies. And at the ſame time, to make the Belief of the Plot obtain amongſt the People, I will order a Day of Thankſgiving for the Diſcovery, which will give the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy an occaſion to run down the Phanaticks, and aſſert the Truth of their Deſign to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Church and State, under the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretext of conſulting how to preſerve and maintain their Religion and Liberties. By
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:98018:168"/> this means I may go on to cut off their Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders ſecurely, and the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernon Sidney</hi> particularly; the former for having dar'd to carry up the Bill of Excluſion to the Houſe of Lords, and becauſe he is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and the apparent Heir to a great Eſtate of Church-lands, which will make him vigorous in his Oppoſition to Popery; and the latter, becauſe of his being an old Rebel againſt my Father, a Perſon of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchical Principles, and one whom the Faction admires for his Counſel and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. I know what will be urg'd in their Defence, as that their innocent Diſcourſes and Meetings are aggravated; that the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt them is infamous and defective; and that my Attorney and others are mov'd with Bribes, and the Proſpect of Preferments from the Court, to harangue them out of their Lives: but thoſe Cobweb-Objections I can eaſily break, now that the Tide runs with as much Violence againſt them as they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it formerly againſt the Catholicks; for which I am obliged to my Biſhops and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, who have eſpous'd the Buſineſs with ſo much Zeal, becauſe I have turn'd the Chaſe upon the Phanaticks. And to engage them yet further, I have ordered ſome of the Scots Presbyterian Gentry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who lurk'd about Town, to be ſent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that ſo the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:98018:168"/> Plot given out to be carried on in both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the Phanaticks and Republicans, may acquire the more univerſal Credit.</p>
               <p>The Death of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> I perceive is a great Mortification to the Party, who are now as much dejected as they were formerly elevated in the time of the Popiſh Plot and ſeditious Parliaments. But that which pleaſes me moſt is, the bringing of the Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in my Kingdoms ſo low, and ſplitting them to pieces by a Wedg of their own, tho I have been deſerted, in a great meaſure, both by my Friends of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> But my Brother, I perceive, carries the thing too far; and I find it generally ſuſpected, that all was not fair in relation to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> yet the News of his having cut his own Throat was of ſingular Uſe to advance the Credit of the Plot, and contributed much to my Lord <hi>Ruſſel's</hi> Condemnation. And though I have no reaſon to bewail his Loſs, becauſe he might have prov'd a dangerous Enemy, yet the Merit of the Father makes me regret the Fate of the Son, which I could wiſh had been more favourable.</p>
               <p>I perceive that it's dangerous to go on in this Method too faſt; and I muſt not give my Brother too much way, leſt I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed dig a Grave for my ſelf: and therefore having gratify'd the Catholicks enough at
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:98018:169"/> once, I may very well be allowed to pauſe a while, and conſider whether I may not be ſhip-wrack'd in the Tempeſt that I have raiſed, before it be too late; and therefore I think it neceſſary to recal the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> whoſe natural Affection will make him tender of my Preſervation. And by this means I ſhall have a Check upon my Brother, though at the ſame time I muſt not allow the Plot to be decried, but find it convenient ſtill to ſacrifice Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> and ſuffer <hi>Speke</hi> and <hi>Braddon</hi> to be proſecuted, for offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to call in queſtion the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been <hi>felo de ſe.</hi> And in the mean time I will take ſurer, though ſlower Meaſures to bring about my Deſigns: For the Heads of the Faction being now cut off, and the whole Party brought under Hatches, I judg it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Policy to diveſt the Corporations of their Charters gradually, while the Church-men are in the ſurrendring Humour, than to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue theſe ſeverer Methods with heat, leſt the People ſhould come at laſt to be enraged, and riſe in an univerſal Rebellion; for if my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſuffered to follow his own Conduct, he will quickly run himſelf and me both off the Stage.</p>

               <head>The Firſt Paper.</head>
               <p>THE Diſcourſe we had the other Day, I hope ſatisfied you in the main, that Chriſt can have but one Church here upon Earth; and I believe that it is as viſible as that the Scriputre is in print, That none can be that Church, but that, which is called the <hi>Roman Catholick Church.</hi> I think you need not trouble your ſelf with entring into that Ocean of particular Diſputes, when the main, and, in truth, the only Queſtion is, Where that Church is, which we profeſs to believe in the two Creeds? We declare there to believe <hi>one Catholick and Apoſtolick Church,</hi> and it is not left to every phantaſtical Man's Head to believe as he pleaſes, but to the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:98018:170"/> Church to whom Chriſt left the Power upon Earth to govern us in Matters of Faith, who made theſe Creeds for our Directions. It were a very irrational thing to make Laws for a Country, and leave it to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to be the Interpreters and Judges of thoſe Laws; for then every Man will be his own Judg, and by conſequence no ſuch thing as either Right or Wrong. Can we therefore ſuppoſe that God Almighty would leave us at thoſe Uncertainties, as to give us a Rule to go by, and to leave every Man to be his own Judg? I do ask any ingenuous Man, whither it be not the ſame thing to follow our own Fancy, or to interpret the Scripture by it? I would have any Man ſhew me, where the Power of deciding Matters of Faith is given to every particular Man. Chriſt left his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to his Church even <hi>to forgive Sins in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and left his Spirit with them, which they exerciſed after his Reſurrection: Firſt by his Apoſtles in theſe Creeds, and many Years after by the Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> where that Creed was made that is called by that Name; and by the Power which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>received from Chriſt, they were the Judges even of the Scripture it ſelf many Years after the Apoſtles, which Books were Canonical and which were not. And if they had this Power then, I deſire to know how they
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:98018:170"/> came to loſe it, and by what Authority Men ſeparate themſelves from that Church? The only Pretence I ever heard of, was, becauſe the Church has fail'd in wreſting and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Scripture contrary to the true Senſe and Meaning of it, and that they have impoſed Articles of Faith upon us, which are not to be warranted by God's Word. I do deſire to know who is to be Judg of that, whether the whole Church, the Succeſſion whereof has continued to this day without Interruption, or particular Men who have raiſed Schiſms for their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?</p>

               <head>The Second Paper.</head>
               <p>IT is a ſad thing to conſider what a world of Hereſies are crept into this Nation: Every Man thinks himſelf as competent a Judg of the Scriptures as the very Apoſtles themſelves; and 'tis no wonder that it ſhould be ſo, ſince that part of the Nation which looks moſt like a Church, dares not bring the true Arguments againſt the other Sects, for fear they ſhould be turned againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and confuted by their own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Church of <hi>England</hi> (as 'tis call'd) would fain have it thought, that they are the Judges in Matters Spiritual, and yet dare not ſay poſitively that there is no Appeal from them; for either they muſt ſay, that they are Infallible, (which they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to) or confeſs that what they decide in Matters of Conſcience, is no further to be followed, than it agrees with every Man's private Judgment. If Chriſt did leave a Church here upon Earth, and we were all once of that Church, how, and by what Authority, did we ſeparate from that Church? If the Power of interpreting of Scripture be in every Man's Brain, what need have we of a Church or Church-men? To
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98018:171"/> what purpoſe then did our Saviour, after he had given his Apoſtles Power to <hi>Bind and Looſe in Heaven and Earth,</hi> add to it, <hi>that he would be with them even to the end of the World?</hi> Theſe Words were not ſpoken Parabolically, or by way of Figure. Chriſt was then aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Glory, and left his Power with his Church, even <hi>to the End of the World.</hi> We have had theſe hundred Years paſt, the ſad Effects of denying to the Church that Power in Matters Spiritual, without an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. What Country can ſubſiſt in Peace or Quiet, where there is not a Supream Judg from whence there can be no Appeal? Can there be any Juſtice done where the Offenders are their own Judges, and equal Interpreters of the Law, with thoſe that are appointed to adminiſter Juſtice? This is our Caſe here in <hi>England</hi> in Matters Spiritual; for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are not of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as 'tis the true Church from whence there can be no Appeal; but becauſe the Diſcipline of that Church is conformable at the preſent to their Fancies; which as ſoon as it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict or vary from, they are ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace or join with the next Congregation of People, whoſe Diſcipline and Worſhip agrees with their Opinion at that time: ſo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Doctrine, there is no other Church, nor Interpreter of Scripture, but
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:98018:172"/> that which lies in every Man's giddy Brain. I deſire to know therefore of every ſerious Conſiderer of theſe things, whether the great Work of our Salvation ought to depend upon ſuch a Sandy Foundation as this? Did Chriſt ever ſay to the Civil Magiſtrate (much leſs to the People) <hi>that he would be with them to the End of the World?</hi> Or, did he give them the Power <hi>to forgive Sins?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Corinthians, <hi>Ye are God's Husbandry, ye are God's Building; we are La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers with God.</hi> This ſhews who are the <hi>Labourers,</hi> and who are the <hi>Husbandry</hi> and <hi>Building:</hi> And in this whole Chapter, and in the preceeding one, St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes great pains to ſet forth that they, the Clergy, <hi>have the Spirit of God, without which no Man ſearcheth the deep things of God;</hi> and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the Chapter with this Verſe, <hi>For who hath known the Mind of the Lord, that he may inſtruct him? But we have the Mind of Chriſt.</hi> Now if we do but conſider in humane Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability and Reaſon, the Powers Chriſt leaves to his Church in the Goſpel, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains ſo diſtinctly afterwards, we cannot think that our Saviour ſaid all theſe things to no purpoſe: And pray conſider on the other ſide, that thoſe who reſiſt the Truth, and will not ſubmit to his Church, draw their Arguments from Implications, and far-fetch'd
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98018:172"/> Interpretations, at the ſame time that they deny plain and poſitive Words; which is ſo great a Diſingenuity, that 'tis not almoſt to be thought that they can believe themſelves. Is there any other Foundation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church, but that if the Civil Magiſtrate pleaſe, he may call ſuch of the Clergy as he thinks fit for his turn at that time; and turn the Church either to <hi>Presbytery, Independency,</hi> or indeed what he pleaſes? This was the way of our pretended Reformation here in <hi>England;</hi> and by the ſame Rule and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it may be altered into as many more Shapes and Forms as there are Fancies in Mens Heads.</p>

            <head>A Brief Account of Particulars occurring at the happy Death of our late Soveraign Lord King <hi>Charles II.</hi> in regard to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; faithfully related by his then Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, Mr. <hi>Jo, Hudleſton.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UPON Thurſday the Fifth of <hi>February,</hi> 1685. between ſeven and eight a Clock in the Evening, I was ſent for in haſte to the Queen's Back-ſtairs at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and deſired to bring with me all things neceſſary for a dying Perſon. Accordingly I came, and was order'd not to ſtir from thence till farther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; being thus obliged to wait, and not having had time to bring along with me the moſt Holy Sacrament of the Altar, I was in ſome Anxiety how to procure it: In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture (the Divine Providence ſo diſpoſing) Father <hi>Bento de Lemos</hi> a <hi>Portugez</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and underſtanding the Circumſtance I was in, readily proffer'd himſelf to go to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and bring the moſt Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment along with him.</p>
            <p>Soon after his Departure I was call'd into the King's Bed-chamber, where approaching to the Bed-ſide, and kneeling down, I in brief
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98018:173"/> preſented his Majeſty with what Service I could perform for God's Honour, and the Happineſs of his Soul at this laſt Moment, on which Eternity depends. The King then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf, That he deſired to die in the Faith and Communion of the Holy Roman Catholick Church; That he was moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry for all the Sins of his Life paſt, and particularly for that he had deferred his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation ſo long; That through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt's Paſſion he hoped for Salvation; That he was in Charity with all the World; That with all his Heart he pardon'd his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and deſired Pardon of all thoſe whom he had any wiſe offended; and that if it pleaſed God to ſpare him longer Life, he would amend it, deteſting all Sin.</p>
            <p>I then advertis'd his Majeſty of the Benefit and Neceſſity of the Sacrament of Penance; which Advertiſement the King moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embracing, made an exact Confeſſion of his whole Life, with exceeding Compunction and Tenderneſs of Heart: which ended, I deſired him, in farther ſign of Repentance and true Sorrow for his Sins, to ſay with me this little ſhort Act of Contrition.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">O my Lord God! with my whole Heart and Soul I deteſt all the Sins of my Life paſt for the Love of Thee, whom I love above all things; and I firmly purpoſe by thy Holy
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:98018:174"/> Grace never to offend Thee more, <hi>Amen,</hi> Sweet Jeſus, <hi>Amen.</hi> Into thy Hands, Sweet Jeſus, I commend my Soul; Mercy, Sweet Jeſus, Mercy.</q> This he pronounced with a clear and audible Voice; which done, and his Sacramental Penance admitted, I gave him Abſolution.</p>
            <p>After ſome time thus ſpent, I asked his Majeſty, if he did not alſo deſire to have the other Sacraments of the Holy Church admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto him? He reply'd, By all means, I deſire to be Partaker of all the Helps and Succours neceſſary and expedient for a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chriſtian in my Condition. I added, And doth not your Majeſty alſo deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the precious Body and Blood of our dear Saviour Jeſus Chriſt in the moſt Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt? His Anſwer was this, If I am worthy, pray fail not to let me have it. I then told him, it would be brought to him very ſpeedily, and deſired his Majeſty, that in the Interim he would give me leave to proceed to the Sacrament of Extreme Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he replied, With all my Heart: I then anointed him, which as ſoon as perform'd I was call'd to the Door, whither the Bleſſed Sacrament was now brought and delivered to me.</p>
            <p>Then returning to the King, I entreated his Majeſty that he would prepare and diſpoſe
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:98018:174"/> himſelf to receive. At which the King rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up himſelf, ſaid, Let me meet my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Lord in a better Poſture than in my Bed. But I humbly begg'd his Majeſty to repoſe himſelf: God Almighty, who ſaw his Heart, would accept of his good Intention. The King then having again recited the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Act of Contrition with me, he received the moſt Holy Sacrament for his Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum, with all the Symptoms of Devotion imaginable. The Communion being ended, I read the uſual Prayers, termed the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Soul, appointed by the Church for Catholicks in his Condition. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the King deſired the Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, <hi>O my Lord God, &amp;c.</hi> to be repeated. This done, for his laſt ſpiritual Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſaid,</p>
            <p>Your Majeſty hath now received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Benefit of all the Sacraments, that a good Chriſtian (ready to depart out of this World) can have or deſire. Now it reſts only, that you think upon the Death and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our dear Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, of which I preſent unto you this Figure (ſhewing him a Crucifix;) lift up therefore the Eyes of your Soul, and repreſent to your ſelf your ſweet Saviour here crucified, bowing down his Head to kiſs you, his Arms ſtretched out to imbrace you, his Body and Members all
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:98018:175"/> bloody and pale with Death to redeem you; and as you ſee him dead and fixed upon the Croſs for your Redemption, ſo have his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance fixed and freſh in your Heart. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him, with all Humility, that his moſt precious Blood may not be ſhed in vain for you; and that it will pleaſe him by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his bitter Death and Paſſion to pardon and forgive you all your Offences: And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to receive your Soul into his bleſſed Hands: and when it ſhall pleaſe him to take it out of this tranſitory World, to grant you a joyful Reſurrection, and an Eternal Crown of Glory in the next. In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So recommending his Majeſty on my Knees, with all the Tranſport of Devotion I was able, to the Divine Mercy and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I withdrew out of the Chamber.</p>
